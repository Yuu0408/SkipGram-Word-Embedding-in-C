where knowledge and curiosity meet new heights are reached students presidents tokyo tech and tmdu kazuya masu president tokyo institute of technology yudai yamazaki tokyo institute of technology sakura kirino tokyo medical and dental university yujiro tanaka president tokyo medical and dental university presentation the next generation of ultra high speed semiconductors and wireless devices yudai yamazaki st year doctoral student department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering tokyo tech unlock a future which no one has yet achieved i conduct research on transceivers for next generation wireless communications such as g and g a typical example of a wireless device is a smartphone but the frequencies used for its communications are microwaves which are primarily frequencies below ghz faster wireless communication will be needed for a variety of applications in the future and current microwave frequencies are already being used by many people and are becoming increasingly strained this has led to the idea that we should look to higher frequencies which has become a trend in next generation wireless communications research millimeter wave band phased array transceiver for use in the millimeter wave band to ghz it gives directionality to signals and enables long distance communications raising hopes for high speed wireless communication you may not have a good idea of what i mean by frequency but i am researching circuits related to high frequencies with an eye to the future they are called millimeter waves and range from ghz to roughly ghz the value of the research is that the use of higher frequencies will allow for increasingly fast wireless communications if we disregard the effects of other factors and calculate only with frequency we believe that using frequencies to times higher than microwaves will increase the data rate of wireless communication by a factor of to thereby increasing what is feasible we heard from two people from tmdu who explained the potential of the technology in medical care one of the things g communication makes possible is telemedicine if a patient is in a rural area and there is no physician in the area there may be instances where an online medical interview is conducted using web conferencing but the treatment that can be done is limited because the image quality in web conferencing tools is not high the use of higher frequencies millimeter waves in g communications will enable faster wireless communications and expand the types of treatments that can be performed in remote locations for example remote robotic surgery in which a doctor in tokyo moves his hand and a robotic arm located in the rural area moves in the same way although direct palpation is not possible if next generation wireless communication is achieved it will be possible to transmit the feeling of touching a patient s body to the doctor through a robotic arm if there is a turning point in my research it may very well be right now when i went on to the doctoral program i started to take on new research challenges i mentioned millimeter waves earlier and the next step is to advance from there to sub terahertz wireless communications research this may sound unfamiliar but if millimeter waves are between and ghz sub terahertz waves are above ghz i mentioned earlier that millimeter waves are to times faster than today s speeds but sub terahertz waves can reportedly achieve speeds to times faster what i am currently struggling with is that i have to start from scratch because it is new research field i had previously been studying millimeter waves with a frequency of about ghz at that frequency i had a lot of prototypes and experimental data amassed by my senior colleagues in the laboratory and i was able to create high precision circuits based on these going forward i will be taking on a completely different frequency so there is no precedent and i will have to build up everything myself from scratch to build a circuit i first need basic data such as the high frequency characteristics of transistors and i am working hard on my own starting with building that design environment i am also making the wireless communication circuitry to be installed on top of that which brings home how challenging this venture is as for my future prospects i would like to further expand the scope of my research through the merger with tmdu my specialization is wireless device circuits but since all my friends around me are also involved in technology i still feel that my own horizons are a bit narrow however the new university will allow me to interact with people from the completely unfamiliar fields of medicine and dentistry as with this session i expect that by visiting each other s laboratories and communicating with each other we will be able to deepen our insights and further apply them to our own research discussion kirino i was glad to hear your presentation i learned that information technology has been and will continue to make the world a better place considering its combination with my own specialization there seems to be a strong compatibility with the robotic surgery that mr yamazaki mentioned we can also transmit japanese medical care to other countries robotic surgery will become better the more it is performed and the level of medical care will continue to improve which is very appealing yamazaki that s interesting i am also interested in robotic surgery and i believe that this is exactly where my research can be applied by the way is it possible to use wireless communication in the operating room i have heard that smart phones cannot be used because some devices are sensitive to radio waves tanaka that is not necessarily the case today i sometimes talk to doctors in the operating room on my smartphone yamazaki oh i see i believe that the operating room is an ideal environment for using high data rate communications the reason is that the higher the frequency the shorter the distance it can travel at frequencies above ghz no matter how hard you try you can only reach to meters although there is a future vision of setting up poles every meters at the initial stage i thought that we should aim to use high frequencies in the confines of a room that requires high data rate communication and i envisioned the operating room as a place well suited to high frequencies hearing president tanaka say that wireless communication is available in the operating room is very encouraging tanaka with a distance of about meters it would be useful in a disaster in the event of a disaster cables are not available but there would be many patients within a meter radius i believe that s exactly the situation in the gaza strip in palestine right now in that situation one doctor can see many patients at once without traveling much it seemed the ideal method in a situation where neither the patient nor the doctor can move presentation identifying the origin of regenerative stem cells and regenerative mechanisms in the intestinal epithelium sakura kirino nd year of doctoral course gastroenterology graduate school of medical and dental sciences tmdu studying cellular mechanisms with patients in mind i am studying the cellular mechanisms related to the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium in recent years inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease have been on the rise and i am studying what happens to cells as a result of inflammation and how the intestinal epithelium regenerates in a healthy state the intestinal epithelium turns over cell shedding and regeneration in a short cycle of about three days and the cycle of new epithelium and shedding of the old one is progressively repeated it is estimated that about of human stools are shredded intestinal epithelium however if the inflammation is too strong the normal turnover mechanism is disrupted and new epithelium cannot be produced this is a critical situation for cells and it has become clear in recent years that various regeneration mechanisms are at work in the body to somehow remedy the situation intestinal stem cells self renew while supplying differentiated cells during the inflammatory phase intestinal stem cells are damaged and self renewal is impaired therefore a mechanism is at work that attempts to de differentiate differentiated cells and revert them to regenerative stem cells at the very bottom of the intestine are stem cells that have the ability to become a variety of cells from which a variety of cells are supplied to the top the cells supplied are slightly more differentiated than stem cells and have their own role in the gut when inflammation occurs and stem cells become scarce or damaged and are unable to turn over cells differentiated from stem cells rejuvenate and become more stem cell like filling in for the stem cells to complement regeneration recently in the medical industry cells are being forced to express genes that make them younger and acquire various roles as in the reprogramming of ips cells by professor shinya yamanaka of kyoto university this is artificially expressed but the same mechanism of going in the opposite direction from differentiation is actually happening naturally in the body however we have only begun to understand that this phenomenon is present we have not yet fully determined what pathology it involves and what cells are most important our laboratory has traditionally been very advanced in d culture techniques for intestinal epithelium and is one of the best in the world we are using mouse and human cell culture techniques to study the mechanisms of cell reprogramming and its involvement in pathological conditions when examining the condition of cells in culture it has been common to make a medium on a flat surface and spread the cells on the medium to investigate what is happening in something as three dimensional as the intestinal epithelium the culture itself must be reproduced in the shape of the intestinal epithelium therefore they are cultured in mini organ organoids three dimensional structures that mimic organs and tissues with the reproduced shape of the intestinal epithelium by doing so we can create a culture condition that is similar to the real intestinal tract and investigate various conditions specifically what we are doing is reproducing diseased intestinal epithelium on organoids dividing it into various cell types and coloring them and then tracking each one and observing how it looks and changes noting for example that this cell behaves this way under these culture conditions or with this kind of inflammation the progeny cells are around here by utilizing organoid culture techniques from tmdu the plasticity of inflammation and regeneration has been reproduced one of the techniques that is gaining so much momentum in biotechnology these days is single cell analysis in the conventional analysis method the area under examination was sampled in bulk and the gene expressions were analyzed single cell analysis allows us to see the genes in each individual cell it is now known that even cells classified as the same cell type or tissue have subtle differences in proteins and rnas that result in different functions and properties being expressed we can process the data on a computer and see what kind of cells are actually expressing what kind of genes by color coding so we use such techniques to observe mouse and human cells although there is not yet a large volume of data available it is possible that both differentiated cells and original stem cells undergo a reprogramming phenomenon that complements regeneration when they become inflamed i would like to continue my research from this vantage point the process by which the information contained in a gene is converted into a form that is actually usable and functions within an organism discussion yamazaki listening to what ms kirino said earlier i was surprised to learn that cells are regenerated at a very rapid rate in the intestines i had wondered what the difference is between muscle inflammation and intestinal inflammation and found it worth studying because of the rapid turnover kirino the intestinal tract is an organ with a fairly neatly constructed stem cell system so it is easier to see the relationship to pathology than muscle from a health professional s perspective as a gastroenterologist i have met quite a few ulcerative colitis patients and i want to cure those people somehow being able to help people in need is the part of my research that i find most rewarding yamazaki i was also interested in the reprogramming of stem cells leaving aside ips cells for the moment could understanding the gut contribute in any way to the regeneration of artificial skin or retina kirino our laboratory is also conducting clinical research on the use of organoids so i believe that we can apply this technology to help people masu what size cells are visible in a single cell analysis kirino depending on the cell type about several tens of micrometers masu for example if you have a line of cells several hundred micrometers across you can observe and control the differences among them in the world of materials engineering too analysis is nowadays conducted at the micrometer and nanometer level the same is true of cryo electron microscopy which is now used for structural analysis and biotechnology there is some overlap in terms of such analysis kirino since this research is ever evolving there are many experiments that have not yet been performed in the laboratory and it is not uncommon for me to start up new ones myself for example communicating with professors and researchers in computer science and other areas outside the laboratory was exactly what we needed to successfully carry out some experiments dialogue curiosity leads to the highest peaks cutting edge research means networking is all the more important tanaka what i felt was similar between the two of you was that you both felt that you needed to do something different from the conventional way of doing things but you had no one to consult with because both of you are working at the cutting edge there are few people to consult with yamazaki indeed there are not many laboratories in japan working on high frequency integrated circuits we are probably the most advanced laboratory in japan in terms of high frequencies so we are in a position where we have no choice but to pioneer a path forward on our own masu i m sure there aren t many but it s more than zero so connections need to be made researchers need to create a network where they can discuss the deep issues professors naturally do this with one another and we also have a network with researchers in other countries it is really important to go out to various places observe and talk to people it is surprisingly acceptable to jump directly into a conversation with a knowledgeable researcher those researchers are happy to hear from students if you approach them yourself and tell them about your research they will surely tell you that there is someone like this in their laboratory that you should meet yamazaki yes that s true i think i will be proactive in conducting my own research my biggest concern is where to implement fast wireless devices i talk to many different researchers and they are all struggling with the question of where exactly to use faster wireless devices with both g and g of course i will continue to study wireless device circuits in depth but perhaps it is important for me now to dive into a field where i can make use of the technology and listen to what people have to say therefore i believe that this merger of our universities will be an opportunity for networking i hope that we can contribute in some way with wireless communication to specific applications in the medical field if we discuss the situations with each other we may find some issues and solutions using wireless communication tanaka there is a building c at our university where new operating rooms and intensive care units have been constructed and it is truly a state of the art environment in japan you cannot enter the operating room because it is sterile but there is a k monitor if you are a student at the university you can see the entire operating room as well as the surgery so please come by i think you will gain some insights by actually seeing it the medical field has problems and i think it would be a very good thing if engineers could join in thinking about them medicine engineering collaboration tends to be a matter of orders received and orders placed but i think it is better to proceed with more interactions from the development stage rather than doctors requesting a certain technology or engineers offering a certain technology they have created working together on what we can valuing everyone s curiosity yamazaki it was interesting to hear about medical care in today s session and i was very glad that president tanaka told me to come see the operating room i also realized how difficult it is to present my research to people in completely different fields and how inadequate my explanations were in that sense i learned a lot kirino i also found today s discussion very interesting i was impressed by mr yamazaki s specific suggestion that his research could be applied in a certain way i was also impressed by the fact that he said that their laboratory is one of the best in the world i look forward to working with a university that has such cutting edge laboratories since we ve arrived at this point i hope we can do something together yamazaki that sounds great i hope to build a relationship where in the course of our research if we want to do fast wireless communication in the operating room we can easily visit the operating room and have discussions together kirino i have long felt that tmdu is really looking forward to the merger with tokyo tech in our researchers social networking groups there are frequent topics such as what could be done through the merger with tokyo tech i was glad to learn today that tokyo tech s members are also looking forward to the merger tanaka i would like to create more opportunities for us to mingle in this way since we are merging there should be an incentive to intermingle although we have already tried a few things i believe that we need a mechanism to provide research funding that transcends the boundaries between the undergraduate and graduate schools of the two universities masu i strongly agree i also still want students to concentrate first of all on what they themselves want to do you must have a standpoint that considers how to implement the results of your research in the real world but it is also important to fully pursue what you yourself want to do before all that i know because i did it myself but i really enjoy researching integrated circuits it is a joy to see how something that could not be done before can be done after designing something in a certain way it is that kind of curiosity that allows us to reach a high level of excellence i hope that while you are still aspiring researchers you will focus on your research and enjoy it to the fullest it is those of us who are in a position to provide guidance such as myself who need to think hard about real world implementation and how to make the most of technology yamazaki as you say my fundamental desire is still to have fun making circuits the next step is to figure out where i can make use of it masu they say that research should be directed at social issues so that it can contribute to society but i would like you to first do curiosity driven research that curiosity will surely create a path for you i like to tell students the grass is always greener on the other side trust your own decisions and make your own way tanaka both of those are definitely essential i hope you will work hard towards your aspirations just as our university will aspire to be the best in science and technology hold on to your dreams and let s pave the way together kazuya masu president tokyo institute of technology in he

using brain waves to reconstruct human activity professor natsue yoshimura school of computing technology that creates the world brain waves are weak electrical signals generated when the brain is active the development of brain machine interfaces bmis which use brain waves or cranial nerve derived signals to connect the brain to a machine and operate it at will is well underway around the world professor natsue yoshimura is using ai to decipher and reproduce body movements and heard speech that are encoded in brain waves welcome to the realm of technology that sifts through vast amounts of biological signals to unravel the activity of the brain reproducing a sound in your mind from brain waves yoshimura bmi technology which measures brain activity signals and uses this information to connect the brain to a computer can be divided into two types in terms of invasiveness i e burden on the body invasive types that involve craniotomy and non invasive types that do not require surgery invasive types can measure signals directly from a specific region of the brain and thus have higher precision in extracting brain information there is a lot of competition in their development especially in europe and the united states in contrast non invasive types pose low risk to the human body but are not precise enough to decipher detailed information non invasive bmis utilize methods such as mri near infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography eeg for measurement but measurement and analysis are generally more difficult than with invasive methods and it has been considered almost impossible to extract detailed brain information from scalp eeg in particular however i have been conducting research to expand the possibilities of non invasive methods in the hopes of making it easier for everyone to monitor their own brain condition the main method used is to estimate neural activity in the brain from eeg using machine learning and extract information as a result of persistent repeated analyses in we succeeded in reproducing the pronunciation of two vowels a and i heard once and recalled in the brain by a human as sounds recognizable by a third party from eeg recorded using electrodes attached to the scalp the desire to know the brain was my starting point and driving force the brain processes stimuli from the outside world to move the body think and generate emotions how do we interpret these mechanisms and reproduce them with technology it is a field without limits that could change the way we live natsue yoshimura natsue yoshimura department of computer science school of computing professor laboratory website researcher profile after receiving her undergraduate degree she worked for several companies before completing the master s program at the graduate school of medical and dental sciences tokyo medical and dental university in in she received her doctorate in engineering from the university of electro communications in after joining tokyo tech she served as assistant professor at the gender equality center and associate professor at the precision and intelligence laboratory and institute of innovative research before assuming her current position in she is a board member of the japanese society for motor control and a member of the japanese society for medical and biological engineering and the japan neuroscience society yoshimura while most bmi research has focused on establishing technology that allows people with arm or leg impairments to operate machines with their brains and obtain higher quality of life we believe that non invasive bmis can be applied to the health care of persons without impairments because of their low risk if men and women young and old can monitor their brains with the ease of a thermometer and quickly detect problems with their bodies and minds it will contribute significantly to the creation of an environment in which people can live independently in an era of year lifespans my motivation for research is the urge to see inside the brain to see what has never before been seen with this single minded determination i left industry and decided to learn brain data analysis and programming from scratch it was years after i graduated from college naturally i had some difficulties but in a sense it was precisely because i was an outsider and had no preconceived notions about the difficulty of extracting information from eeg that i was undaunted by the challenge which led to the results we are seeing today i will continue to follow my intellectual desires without making assumptions about my own potential and will continue to unravel the information processing of the brain which is still an unknown world four ways to understand how the brain processes information mri scan non invasive method that places less burden on the body using a type of mri called functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri the head is scanned to visualize brain activity this method is used at yoshimura lab using a type of mri called functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri the head is scanned to visualize brain activity this method is used at yoshimura lab using a type of mri called functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri the head is scanned to visualize brain activity this method is used at yoshimura lab using a type of mri called functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri the head is scanned to visualize brain activity this method is used at yoshimura lab an opening is made in the skull and a millimeter scale electrode is implanted in a specific part of the brain to measure the electrical signals emitted from neurons electrode sheet placed on the surface of the brain invasive method involving surgery the skull is surgically opened and a sheet several centimeters in size with numerous electrodes is placed on the surface of the brain to measure signals from the cerebral cortex humans have been searching for a map of the brain to determine which parts of the brain are responsible for which activities information processing in the brain is the last huge frontier of the human body the human brain is composed of approximately billion neurons when stimulated by sensory organs neurons transmit electrical signals to each other to process information and brain waves are the result of this electrical activity it is one of the human biological signals like pulse heartbeat electrocardiogram and electromyogram which are signals emitted by muscle contractions in british scientist richard caton first reported electrical activity in the animal brain and in german psychiatrist hans berger finally recorded an active current from the human cerebral cortex five years later berger published his work naming this brain activity an electroencephalogram eeg has a relatively fast response time after the body is stimulated and has the advantage that it can be measured from the scalp there have been many attempts to analyze the data but it has not gotten as far as practical use the reason lies in the difficulty of non invasive eeg measurement and analysis when measuring eeg from electrodes attached to the scalp large noises that are difficult to remove during the measurement phase such as muscle activity and radio waves from surrounding electronic devices are included preventing the extraction of these very small amplitude signals furthermore the eeg waveform rules are not as clear cut as those for pulse and heartbeat making it extremely difficult to discern eeg that represents specific information since the s there has been a movement to use ai to analyze eeg but the aforementioned barriers still stand in the way of researchers reproducing sound from eeg as a pioneer in the analysis of non invasive brain data yoshimura has worked on decoding information on movement hearing speech and emotion and has successfully extracted muscle activity finger movements and many other physical behaviors from eeg in particular yoshimura s announcement in of a technology to reproduce sounds someone has heard or recalled from eeg suggests the possibility of advancing brain science toward elucidation of functional brain areas and paving the way for development of future applications such as bmis in this study a novel technique was presented that uses machine learning and deep learning to estimate parameters that represent the frequency characteristics of speech from eeg when the two vowels a and i are heard and then reconstructs the sound from these parameters at the time there were almost no examples of speech reconstruction that were clear enough for a third party to hear and distinguish even with the invasive methods so it is an astounding finding that speech reconstruction at about accuracy is possible using non invasive methods the low spatial resolution that had been a problem in extracting information from eeg was improved through ai powered computational processing resulting in the reproduction of speech and regarding the need to provide a large number of samples to use deep learning it is also possible to employ new data expansion techniques that generate fluctuations from a single source data in the past it was common to simply identify whether the restored sound was an a or an i however the possibility of reproducing the speech waveform itself and capturing it as a distinct sound has been verified and this could lead to the reproduction of speech in the mind which differs from person to person we are currently working on developing a machine learning model that can reproduce speech sounds other than just a and i furthermore the deep learning we employed this time is not a black box with unknown analysis principles it can be used to determine where in the brain the pathway to hearing and recalling speech is located although the language areas used for human speech has been largely identified there are large individual differences making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of these areas however the advantage of non invasive measurements that can broadly estimate signals throughout the brain should allow us to evaluate auditory speech and language processing in the brain in the future yoshimura progress in eeg measurement through eeg caps when measuring eegs from the scalp a cap with multiple electrodes called an eeg cap is often used yoshimura lab primarily uses eeg caps with electrodes and a special gel is inserted between the electrodes and the scalp to ensure contact and improve the quality of the eeg signal to be measured not long ago preparation involving scraping the sebum from the scalp was essential to obtain an accurate signal but now taking into account the comfort of the experiment participants a variety of eeg caps have been developed to make them easier to use research is also underway to miniaturize devices while maintaining measurement precision and there are remarkable technological innovations in hardware as we move toward a future in which individuals will be able to easily utilize eeg the promise of non invasive bmis the medical field is leading the way on applied research on bmis from the early stages of their emergence bmis have been used to support the movement and rehabilitation of quadriplegic patients and as a means of communicating intention for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als patients meanwhile braintech which utilizes bmis in various industries to open up new business domains has rapidly attracted attention braintech is a coined word that combines brain and technology brain science is becoming more accessible every day but most are invasive bmis and other devices implanted in the brain the non invasive technology developed by yoshimura will benefit not only medicine but society as a whole because of its safety i imagine a future in which anyone can easily check the condition of their brain by applying information extraction from eeg which we have been researching to enable individuals to detect early on a decline in brain function and to care for it in a game like manner the extraction of motion information could also be applied to the entertainment domain we actually get requests from people who want to control vr with their brains instead of a controller yoshimura yoshimura lab does not reject any ideas from students but rather transforms that inner curiosity into energy the intellectual and organic connections they make are like the eeg signals they study they emerge and intersect and the full picture is unfathomable the possibilities for the future are tremendous the evolution of eeg analysis has expanded the options for experimental tasks in eeg experiments researchers have struggled with how to eliminate noise in the experimental phase due to how small the signals are in the past it was customary to perform simple experimental tasks while having the participant avoid blinking but with the development of analytical methods to separate noise from eeg this practice is becoming a thing of the past yoshimura lab is currently working to understand the information processing mechanisms in the brain related to motor control by examining eeg during juggling training exercise experiment using vr goggles exercise experiment using liquid crystal shutter goggles monitoring with sensors attached to the body terms brain waves brain waves are wave like signals produced by the brain they can be broadly classified into two types those measured from the cerebral cortex and those measured from the scalp the latter are measured with electroencephalography eeg when people refer to brain waves they are typically referring to eeg spatial resolution in eeg measurement a measure of how precisely signals generated from specific brain regions or sources of neural activity are reflected in signals measured on the scalp data fluctuation predictive uncertainty or variability among data here it refers to data with different patterns within the range that the ai can recognize as the same type of information school of computing creating the future

a new dimension of sensing using functional peptides professor mina okochi school of materials and chemical technology technology that creates the world peptides possess a wide variety of physiological activities in peptide biosensors researchers try to design and synthesize peptides with specific functions and then use those peptides as probes of sensors this application is being actively studied all over the world in recognition of its high sensitivity and specificity professor mina okochi has been working on screening of various functional peptides which can be applied for biosensors welcome to a world of biotechnology and biosensors in which desired functions are derived from a myriad of possibilities searching for peptides with desired functions and using them as biosensors a biosensor is a chemical sensor that enables the detection and quantification of specific molecules by using biomolecular interactions and biological reactions as elements for identification biosensors can measure or monitor specific molecules and activities they have been gradually developed since the s furthermore technology using peptides for identification began to attract attention from around the s peptides can be used as probes for identifying various targets based on their amino acid sequences in this way peptides have greatly expanded the range of applications for biosensors i have been doing research on the search for functional peptides since when screening of a specific sequence to give a desired function to a peptide it is necessary to search from a vast combination of amino acid bonds therefore in order to efficiently conduct trials i use a method called peptide array this method consists of solid phase synthesis that systematically combines a large number of peptides even after discovering a target sequence i conduct repeated verifications and consider the appropriate design for using the sequence as an identification probes this series of steps is known as a peptide screening in recent years i have been particularly focused on the search for functional peptides capable of detecting odor molecules as well as the application of those peptides to develop odor sensors in february in collaboration with a professor of materials science i succeeded in developing a highly sensitive graphene odor sensor using peptides the sensor can be used to detect volatile organic compounds which are the source of odors in this research i am mainly designing a probe that detects limonene the smell of lemon that is a peptide used as a substance for detecting a specific target a big step toward realizing a bioelectronic nose living organisms are composed of multiple combinations of functions and mechanisms that recognize molecules this research field is worth exploring to unravel its endless mechanisms and discover new possibilities for applications mina okochi department of chemical science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology professor laboratory website researcher profile in completed her doctorate at the graduate school of engineering tokyo university of agriculture and technology in appointed as research associate at the department of biotechnology and life science in the faculty of engineering tokyo university of agriculture and technology in appointed as lecturer at the department of applied chemistry chemical engineering and biotechnology in the graduate school of engineering nagoya university in promoted to associate professor at the same department assumed her current position in doctor of biotechnology tokyo university of agriculture and technology specializes in peptide engineering in received the th technical award of the society for biotechnology japan odor sensors using peptides have potential applications in a wide range of fields including healthcare environmental monitoring food and cosmetics many attempts have been made to develop a bioelectronic nose that electrically detects odors by using olfactory receptors of mammals into biosensors however the difficulty of creating arranging receptors and the low stability are barriers however peptides can be synthesized using any amino acid sequence and are relatively stable this will make it possible to develop sensors that can respond to various odor molecules since obtaining my ph d i have been working as a researcher for more than years when i was a student i conducted research in a different area within bioelectronics one reason why i started to study biotechnology was the human genome project that had been in progress around the world when i was a university student around the time i finished graduate school i received an announcement that major advancements had been made in genome analysis my heart raced at the prospect of major changes in biological research regardless of what path one takes there are always new developments in research by remaining true to my interests i will pursue sensing that pushes the limits of current technology relationship among peptides proteins and amino acids together with carbohydrates and fats proteins are known as one of the three major nutrients proteins are also the material for our skin hair nails internal organs and muscles composed of more than amino acids proteins are an essential substance for human life however protein molecules in their normal state are too large to be assimilated by the human body therefore proteins are digested to amino acids or peptides which consist of two or more amino acids linked in a chain using digestive enzymes peptides are diverse in form and function there are types of amino acids that compose human proteins and peptides however peptides have a huge number of sequences peptides are extremely diverse combining two amino acids will result in types x while combining three amino acids will result in types x x peptides fulfill numerous functions in life activities the functions known at present are truly rich in variety for example peptides are well known for functions such as protecting the body from bacteria lowering blood pressure controlling blood sugar suppressing inflammatory reactions and protecting cells from oxidative stress peptides are already widely used in fields such as the development of drugs and cosmetics using peptides as nanomaterials in engineering by utilizing their functionality and small size peptides can be applied to engineering for example by converting the peptide binding to a specific molecule into a signal that can be handled by a machine we can create a sensor for measuring the presence and quantity of molecules that we want to detect but are not visible to the human eye peptides also have a wide range of other engineering applications examples include aiding in nanoparticle synthesis by controlling the shape and size of nanoparticles helping drugs reach target tissues through the use of cell penetrating peptides and using peptides as a component of biomaterials that are widely utilized in the medical and dental fields each biological reaction consists of intricate chemical reactions carried out by proteins at the molecular level peptides are the key to artificially controlling these reactions a biosensor is a chemical sensor that utilizes the exceptional molecular recognition ability of living organisms to acquire quantitative information on a specific molecule a biosensor consists of three main components the first component is the bioreceptor a biological element that recognizes the target molecule the second is the transducer which converts the signal recognized by the element into a measurable signal such as light or electricity the third is the amplifier which processes appropriately amplifies and digitizes the signal converted by a transducer many scientists and researchers have been involved in the development of biosensors for a long time however the glucose enzyme electrode invented by american scientist leland c clark in is considered to be the beginning of biosensors since then many biosensors have been produced up to the present day using materials such as proteins dna microorganisms cells and tissues as bioreceptors it is said that peptides began to be used as recognition receptor molecules around the s the high specificity of peptides makes them superior receptors peptides are molecules that can act with pinpoint accuracy on specific proteins or molecules by binding amino acids thereby enabling accurate detection and recognition of targets unlike proteins which are composed of tens to thousands of amino acids and have complex structures that are difficult to synthesize artificially peptides have simple structures can be synthesized relatively easily and are stable by taking advantage of these properties and conducting repeated trials researchers are screening functional peptides that can specifically bind to the molecule to be detected and serve as a receptor in this way the history of biosensor development using peptides is closely related to the advancements in peptide screening the challenge of quantitatively detecting odors in order to constantly explore new possibilities for biosensing okochi has been searching for many types of functional peptides using peptide arrays in particular her latest research is on the design of functional peptides that detect and identify limonene a plant derived odor molecule in the past various countries have worked to develop bioelectronic noses that imitate the odor sensing mechanism of mammals and use olfactory receptors as receptors unfortunately several issues have hindered the practical implementation of these research initiatives specifically the acquisition route of olfactory receptors has been an issue olfactory receptors are generally biosynthesized through the involvement of living organisms and enzymes this biosynthesis requires specialized skills and equipment which requires a large amount of funds of course the number of receptors that can be created is limited due to biosynthesis furthermore even if a receptor functions in vivo there is also the problem of the receptor losing its function and stability as the sensing probes peptides are an alternative substance that can compensate for these weaknesses until recently the development of odor sensors using peptides had not progressed significantly even on a global scale however in a research team led by okochi announced a graphene odor sensor that utilizes peptides with an additional amino acid sequence interacting with specific odor molecules using such peptides the team succeeded in high sensitivity detection of odor molecules which are difficult to detect additionally by performing a principal component analysis of the electrical response of the sensor the team achieved differentiation of dissimilar odors from complex odor information i took on the challenge of searching for functional peptides with the theme of odor because i believed that chemical sensors could fulfill the role of detection dogs used in animal and plant quarantine operations at airports explains okochi prior to focusing on the smell of limonene i was working on sensing to detect the explosive tnt trinitrotoluene practical use of biosensors will make it possible to observe odors objectively which is difficult when conducting qualitative detection by humans and animals in the future if we can use this research to develop new sensors that are comparable to the olfactory sense of living organisms the scope of application will expand sequentially for example in addition to detecting foreign objects it will become possible to detect diseases monitor environmental conditions and control product quality a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer which is also used to analyze the components contained in odorants mechanism of odor molecule detection observed on the surface of graphene a biosensor requires a mechanism that converts a specific reaction into a change in electric current and then captures that change as a signal in the case of the graphene odor sensor jointly announced with the research team led by associate professor yuhei hayamizu in the change in peptide structure caused by the binding of volatile organic compounds which are odor molecules to the peptide on graphene which is a two dimensional carbon material is measured as a signal hayamizu conducts research on self assembling peptides for a graphene odor sensor use in allergy treatment peptide analysis using peptide arrays is not limited to use as a biosensor it is also useful as a technology that supports testing and treatment of people suffering from food allergies in okochi and her collaborators were awarded the technology award of the society for biotechnology japan in recognition of research on low antigenic bioactive peptides for milk allergy in food allergies the immune system overreacts to specific proteins antigens contained in food thus causing allergic symptoms explains okochi currently milk peptides which are highly enzymatically digested milk proteins are used throughout the world for the treatment of milk allergy since various peptide sequences are mixed in milk peptides in order to improve the accuracy of suppressing allergic reactions we cooperated with food companies to identify the sequences of antigenic peptides and develop technology for highly sensitive detection and quantification okochi laboratory is exploring the multifaceted functionality of peptides envisioning applications as they search for the desired peptides students in the laboratory are also passionate about this research that has endless potential potential made possible by functional peptides peptide synthesizer a peptide synthesizer automatically synthesizes peptides by combining different amino acids in order these synthesizers are indispensable for making peptide arrays and improving the efficiency of peptide screenings the peptide synthesizer which belongs to okochi laboratory can synthesize types of peptides in an array at once a process that takes about three to four days inside the peptide synthesizer terms physiological activities the actions exerted by chemical substances in the living organism on specific physiological regulation functions of the organism solid phase synthesis a method of synthesizing peptides and proteins in which a molecule is immobilized on a solid support and chemically

from sweets to space science connects the world hiraku sakamoto associate professor school of engineering and mayu takeshita ceo takeshita seika co ltd mayu takeshita a tokyo tech graduate is the fifth president of takeshita seika which manufactures and sells black mont blanc a local specialty ice cream in kyushu and associate professor hiraku sakamoto who develops nanosatellites for proof of concept experiments in space what emerged from the dialogue between these two professionals from different fields is an unexpected common denominator space exploration tracing the trajectory of these two reveals the fundamental value of science involving others in the pursuit of big dreams microsatellites using origami techniques figure origamisat sakamoto i have been researching ways to build large scale space structures the key to achieving this is origami technology which involves folding thin film on which devices such as solar cells and antennas are mounted into a smaller size this technology makes it possible to store thin films inside a rocket with limited volume and then unfold them in space currently we are in the process of developing a nanosatellite with students in our laboratory for demonstration in space ms takeshita you are the president of takeshita seika which manufactures and sells black mont blanc what was your reason for enrolling at tokyo tech takeshita it all started with the international design contest idc robocon which i saw on tv when i was a child i was moved by the way students from all over the world worked together to build robots transcending nationality and language barriers i decided i wanted to enter the contest and started looking into it that s when i found out that tokyo tech was the only japanese university taking part at the time when i was in the fifth grade of elementary school i asked my parents to get an application form for me and i became aware of the possibility of going to tokyo tech after enrolling at tokyo tech i devoted myself to studying in the department of industrial and systems engineering in anticipation of taking over the family business at the same time i also took classes in a department that has produced generations of idc robocon contestants and informed the instructor of my intention to take part due to these efforts i participated in the th idc robocon held at the massachusetts institute of technology mit in my college experience made me realize that i should have a go at everything i want to and not give up black mont blanc a famous dessert in kyushu takeshita seika s signature product is a bar of vanilla ice cream coated with chocolate and crumbles now in the th year since its release it is loved as soul food by the people of kyushu recently it has been sold in stores in the kanto region and online sakamoto i strongly sympathize with your positive attitude toward realizing your dreams my own childhood fascination with science fiction led me to pursue space colony architecture however when i was a sophomore in high school preparing to choose a career path i learned that there were no universities in japan that researched space architecture after much agonizing i turned to newton a science magazine that featured space architecture at the time i sent a letter to the editorial office and an author kindly provided me with a list of researchers in japan who work with space structures using this information as a guide i enrolled at the university of tokyo and studied under a professor who was active at the jaxa institute of space and astronautical science in addition i wrote my master s degree thesis in english in order to achieve my other goal of attending mit eventually after completing my doctoral studies at the university of colorado boulder i was able to work as a postdoctoral fellow at mit takeshita you really took the initiative being in a challenging environment leads to personal growth while i met excellent students at tokyo tech and realized my own shortcomings i began to search for a position that would be the right fit for me the realization that what is difficult to accomplish alone can be accomplished by collaborating with peers is something that has carried over to every aspect of my life after graduation sakamoto when you are pushing toward a goal it is important to involve the people around you of course in order to solicit cooperation you must propose something of value not only to yourself but also to those around you i believe that by devising ways to make everyone involved happy i can continue to pursue my dreams taking on the vastness of space to bring people happiness takeshita immediately after enrolling in university i took part in an event to celebrate the opening of the national museum of emerging science and innovation miraikan in tokyo as part of my club activities the event was a panel discussion between astronaut mamoru mohri and tokyo tech students the words of someone who has actually set foot in space were very impressive and ever since then i have been thinking that i want to see space someday too it is very interesting to hear from you dr sakamoto what changes have you seen in the nature of your research so far sakamoto i discovered the importance of origami technology during my college years and immersed myself in the topic during my master s degree the turning point was the small solar power sail project led by jaxa a solar sail refers to a spacecraft that uses an ultra thin film sail to propel itself under the force of solar pressure i was involved in the development of the ikaros demonstrator and was in charge of simulation of the deployment of the square meter membrane structure the rocket carrying ikaros was launched in and successfully completed its mission the result was a great success but it was a shock to me that the behavior of the membrane in space was not as simulated this issue made me acutely aware of the fact that it is impossible to know if a system is viable without first observing the entire process from planning to operation in space since then i have been working with students in the laboratory to plan develop and demonstrate in space nanosatellites as an integrated process in we launched a nanosatellite origamisat with the main mission of deploying a square meter thin film in space currently we are developing origamisat which contains a thin film with an antenna on it with the aim of communicating with the ground from space engagement in club activities she was a founding member of the official club tokyo tech science techno in order to convey the joy of science and technology to people science craft classes and science shows were held together with her colleagues from that time she has been promoting the space mont blanc project and the exchanges continue to this day takeshita it s a very ambitious mission in fact takeshita seika is also working on a project titled the space mont blanc project the goal is to launch a black mont blanc in a space balloon that will fly to the stratosphere and capture images with space and earth in the background in addition we are also studying ways to keep ice cream launched into space frozen so that it tastes good on the ground we are currently on pause due to the covid pandemic but when we restart we hope to share with you the excitement of ice cream s scientific journey into space sakamoto there is also growing anticipation that the era of eating ice cream in space may soon be upon us takeshita developing ice cream as a space food is a medium term goal i believe that sweets have the power to make people petit happy whenever i feel tired or anxious eating something sweet soothes and invigorates me my dream is to bring sweets that delight people to japan the world and even outer space sakamoto it will take time to implement the results of my research in the real world but i too would like to see a future in which deployable membrane structures have brought happiness to people i would be happy if i could make repeated contributions and someday realize that my research has really benefited the world to demonstrate for the first time anywhere that it is possible to navigate in space using only a sail and to generate electricity using thin film solar cells ikaros was launched by the h iia launch vehicle no on may sharing a ride with the venus climate orbiter akatsuki communicating the significance and joy of science through research that contributes to society takeshita since assuming my position i have often been featured as the female company president who graduated from tokyo tech while i was pleased with the level of interest i was also concerned about the small number of female students going into science fields in fact only about percent of students majoring in science fields at universities and graduate schools in japan are women on the other hand in some foreign countries the ratio of male to female students pursuing science fields is almost equal in light of this situation we have no choice but to believe that in order to increase the number of female science students in japan education and awareness raising activities prior to university and graduate school must be reconsidered in order to convey the joy of science to children in recent years i have been giving lectures and doing other activities mainly in my hometown sakamoto i think that s a very meaningful initiative science is an approach to nature and a discipline that can help solve a variety of problems it is nothing less than science s ability to accumulate information that makes these applications possible newton described it as standing on the shoulders of giants the findings of our predecessors accumulated in the form of papers provide us with new solutions also important is the community of scientists science has developed through discussions among experts based on logical thinking i hope that tokyo tech students will master both scientific knowledge and communication through our laboratories clubs and robot contests working together in a community sakamoto laboratory is conducting research to build large structures in space this includes the development of deployable membrane structures and space antennas as well as the study of systems for building large structures particular emphasis is placed on space demonstrations using nanosatellites built by the students themselves we respect the autonomy of students and offer a wide range of activities takeshita i have a deep respect for scientists who have a wealth of insight that is why i feel a sense of frustration when collaboration with society and fundraising languish due to overconcentration on research creating two way communication between scientists and society would create a large synergistic effect my college experience made me realize that i should play a role in bridging the gap between them in my day to day work i try to base dialogues on scientific knowledge when meeting with machinery manufacturers sakamoto as you say when scientists devote themselves to research only to pursue their interests they often become shortsighted this is not sustainable as they cannot expect the people in their environment to appreciate or fund their research for this reason my laboratory encourages students working on research to think about how the results of their research can be useful to society takeshita from this viewpoint they realize that most research connects to the real world everything around us including ice cream is the product of science most people may have the impression that there is a high barrier to science but it is supposed to be a very accessible and approachable discipline i hope that through our activities many people will learn about the fascination of science and experience the excitement of it there s more growing intellectual curiosity satellites tokyo tech offers many opportunities for students to work on satellite development one of the classes involves the design fabrication and operation of cansat a mock satellite the size of a milliliter can every september they take part in a competition in nevada usa to launch a cansat to an altitude of km the goal is to complete a potential oriented mission during flight or after landing the insights gained from these demonstrations are being applied to the actual development of satellites product development black mont blanc was born out of an idea of the former chairman of takeshita seika who saw mont blanc the highest peak in the alps how delicious would it be to eat a pure white mountain with chocolate poured over it that idea became a reality resulting in a long selling well loved product capturing the universe and the earth in the space mont blanc project may provide new inspiration for product development i began researching space structures because of my love for science fiction focusing on connecting with society and

stories born from the space between fantasy and reality yoshimi takuwa lecturer future of humanity research center institute for liberal arts and hebizo copywriter manga artist original author hebizo creates manga on various themes including science yoshimi takuwa is a lecturer who conducts research on the history of science the two have teamed up as manga artist and editorial supervisor to create works that interweave unique fantasy and real knowledge how do these creators use their respective expertise to produce stories that resonate with a wide readership this dialogue provides a behind the scenes glimpse of their creations two people fascinated by the depth of scientific history infinite possibilities expanding through co creation takuwa history of science is the study of how various scientific concepts experimental methods and other matter related to science have changed historically i was fascinated by the life of isaac newton and his experiments with light acting upon this interest i first earned my bachelor s degree in physics and then began to study history of science in earnest upon entering the master s program i started supervising manga when the research lab where i used to work received a request from hebizo hebizo you incorporate a wide variety of themes into your work what made you particularly interested in scientific history hebizo my interest was sparked when i read a novel that my friend had recommended it was about researchers who laid the foundations of science and technology i was shocked to learn that the everyday life which we take for granted is supported by the extraordinary hard work and discoveries of scientists and i wanted to create a manga depicting the drama surrounding these researchers that said biographies are frequently overly dramatized by later generations i felt the need for expert guidance to prevent me from confusing historical facts with legends when i visited a tokyo tech professor and inquired about editorial supervision for my project i was introduced to dr takuwa takuwa the first manga that i was involved in was kesshite mane shinaide kudasai please do not attempt ever this manga covers numerous scientists and their achievements and i spent days reading through materials in order to supervise its production the next project i supervised was tenchi sozo dezain bu heaven s design team this manga focused on biology topics so i had to investigate matters beyond my expertise for example i read about long necked dinosaurs to see what would happen if a giraffe s neck were stretched even further it was a novel and irreplaceable experience to venture into unknown territory together with hebizo s story points to convince the readers during supervision of the manga takuwa not only corrected mistakes but also provided relevant information that should be noted although it may have appeared superfluous takuwa s sharing of her knowledge in advance allowed the author to use her own understanding to accurately answer any questions from the readers this supports the credibility of the story hebizo manga must allow for inadequate explanations because it prioritizes ease of understanding for the reader there were many aspects of my story that went against the intentions of experts after taking these circumstances into consideration dr takuwa carefully explained such mistakes and related reasons she then offered a number of alternatives to make the story work she also raised accurate points word by word i was surprised by her attention to detail that goes beyond her field of research one episode which had a particularly strong impression on me occurred when a centaur was featured in heaven s design team the following question was raised as part of the manga a centaur has both the body of a human and a horse and should therefore have two sets of ribs in which set should the internal organs such as the heart be placed in response dr takuwa raised the following correction the heart is a circulatory organ and should not be referred to as naizo naizo the japanese word for internal organs does not include the circulatory and nervous systems i was impressed by her attitude of thoroughly investigating even the smallest details takuwa of course in my role as editorial supervisor i did my best to make the story persuasive during this process i faced a barrier in terms of scientific communication using scientific terminology at a junior high school level to explain specialized knowledge such as theory of relativity and quantum mechanics requires a lot of effort i remember one time when i sent a hand written formula for the manga the printers nearly printed as the similar letter p because they weren t familiar with how greek letters are used to represent physical quantities normally i hadn t paid much attention to my interactions with science and engineering students however through my exchanges with hebizo i was able to explore ways of communicating with people who are unfamiliar with scientific expertise or conventions interesting stories and accurate knowledge delivering works which combine both for the reader hebizo creativity and research are fields where ideas and uniqueness are often strong points dr takuwa how do you incorporate your unique personality into your research takuwa the majority of research in the history of science is conducted using historical methods that refer to written materials such as notebooks on experiments and academic conference records of the time however relying on such materials alone makes it impossible to discover things which were not put in writing for example the theory and experiment results may not have matched or the experiment itself may have failed therefore i replicate experiments as a means of understanding the trial and error process that is not found in literature for example galileo galilei proposed the law of free fall which states that the speed of falling is the same regardless of the weight of the object galileo is said to have proved this theory by dropping two balls of different weights from the leaning tower of pisa in his experiment both balls are said to have hit the ground at the same time however if you replicated the same experiment you will find that the heavier ball hits the ground first due to air resistance in this way historical experiment results are often reconstructed to match the claimed theory i enjoy learning new facts which have to be deduced it also allows me to utilize my experience from conducting experiments in the physics department during my university days hebizo the attitude of finding a niche area where you can demonstrate your strengths is also applicable to the production of manga on the other hand the difficult part of entertainment is the need not only for originality but also for the appeal of classic stories with which many readers can sympathize while applying my standard of whether or not i find something interesting i also observe the reactions of people around me to help me during times of indecision takuwa i teach history of science in the liberal arts i feel that it is important to make students recognize interesting aspects in order to motivate students to study seriously therefore at the beginning of each class i pose questions such as did galileo galilei really say and yet it moves in reference to the earth and why do japanese people think that the rainbow has seven colors i then provide explanations based on historical materials if students recognize the surprising facts behind the discourse that was assumed to be common knowledge they will be motivated to learn the formula of interesting works when watching movies and other works i thoroughly analyze what makes them interesting i take detailed notes on aspects such as the time allotted for introducing plots and introducing characters and the timing allotted for foreshadowing finding the formula of works that are loved by the public and replacing elements of the formula with unique values is essential for creating attractive works hebizo the desire to introduce interesting aspects which people usually overlook is the driving force behind my creation in order to convert my ideas into manga that grabs the reader s attention in the first four pages i have to use various methods such as incorporating the formula that is common to popular works i pay particular attention to the balance between entertainment and fact striving for moderate dramatization which does not mislead the reader takuwa i feel that all of hebizo s works feature an exquisite balance of interesting stories and accurate knowledge up until now i have been helping to disseminate information as an editorial supervisor for manga however in the future i intend to publish a book that conveys the appeal of newton s life and experiments while utilizing what i learned through collaboration with hebizo i would like to create my own standard that links both interest and accuracy the key to conveying the appeal of learning is combining the strengths of manga artists and experts takuwa while serving as editorial supervisor i was impressed by hebizo s desire to understand areas beyond her own knowledge and experience and as well as her respect for the opinions of experts moreover each one of her works has detailed supplements to items introduced in each story this shows hebizo s respect for specialized fields for example kesshite mane shinaide kudasai please do not attempt ever is accompanied by footnotes and references as well as special interviews which introduce comments by researchers in tenchi sozo dezain bu heaven s design team the detailed ecology of the creatures introduced in the manga is summarized in an encyclopedia of living things you are adept at stimulating the reader s interest and guiding them to more accurate knowledge hebizo thank you very much for saying so i create manga with the intention of opening a peephole into the so called ivory tower that is the space where experts devote themselves to academic research everyone can see the view through the peephole however we mustn t be fooled into thinking that we see the whole picture therefore in my work i try to highlight unique cases that draw people s attention while also showing the paths that lead to specialized knowledge it is important to convey to the reader the profound fascination of learning while still adhering to the premise relatable sci tech episodes this manga is filled with small jokes that will not only resonate with students with specialized knowledge in science and technology but will also amuse other readers the t shirt worn by takuwa incorporates the package design of the industrial wipers kimwipes produced by nippon paper crecia used for wiping laboratory equipment the same t shirt is also worn by characters in the manga takuwa when i learned that a manga about scientific history would be produced i was actually worried about whether it would be interesting to general readers however after supervising kesshite mane shinaide kudasai please do not attempt ever i realized that my worries were unfounded this manga features a dual structure depicting the daily life of science and technology students and the episodes of scientists told therein this structure makes it enjoyable for everyone regardless of knowledge i realized that the relatable episodes of science and technology which i had thought would be rejected by readers were depicted in an interesting way and loved by a wide range of readers it was also an opportunity to experience the splendor of student life at tokyo tech hebizo i m so happy to hear you say that because my goal was to convey the interesting aspects of daily life by students at tokyo tech my lifelong theme is to transform learning into entertainment in order to spread the appeal of learning to many people i will continue to work on manga production with a focus on elements such as media franchising for that reason it is essential to have cooperation from editorial supervisors with scientific expertise like dr takuwa besides manga there are many other works in the entertainment industry that require expert knowledge in addition to research and educational activities it would be nice if supervision was added to the job options takuwa i have also broadened my interests through works depicting scientists and their history so i strongly feel the importance of entertainment experts can provide detailed explanations of research fields however in order to make a story accessible for everyone to enjoy the cooperation of creators such as manga artists and original authors is indispensable in order to expand the base of science i hope that the scope of collaboration will grow even further in the future there s more growing intellectual curiosity rainbow the expression seven colored rainbow which is common in japan is influenced by newton s theory newton claimed that shining white light sunlight through a prism would disperse it and divide it into seven primary colors however when replicating newton s experiments the color of the dispersed light changes continuously this makes it difficult to clearly distinguish the seven colors a closer look at experimental results reveals that the theories and proofs that we learn in school are surprisingly complex dialogue character dialogue is important to convey expertise in an easy to understand manner one trick is to use impactful metaphors and expressions within a range that is not far from the facts for example when introducing isaac newton it is easier to get a certain amount of interest from readers by presenting him as a narrow minded recluse however when using expressions that not everyone will understand it is also necessary to consider my target and choose my words appropriately achievements of scientists who support everyday life from behind the scenes by relying on the knowledge of experts i create manga that shows the paths of scientists to my readers hebizo copywriter manga artist original author former part time lecturer at tokyo institute of technology after working as a copywriter at a video game company hebizo went independent her comic essay nihonjin no shiranai nihongo the japanese that the japanese don t know hebizo nagiko umino kadokawa became a bestseller her manga kesshite mane shinaide kudasai please do not attempt ever hebizo kodansha which was based on tokyo tech was adapted into a tv drama on nhk general tv in tenchi sozo dezain bu heaven s design team hebizo tsuta suzuki tarako kodansha was adapted into an anime in i was fascinated by the experiments and lives of scientists so i embarked on the path of research supervising manga projects has allowed me to discover various new fields and expand my interests yoshimi takuwa associate professor

integrating optical information to create a d image in space the forefront of hologram research professor masahiro yamaguchi school of engineering technology that creates the world holography captures the d optical information and reproduces objects as d images it has already permeated society being widely applied in areas such as anti counterfeiting design and art however holography in which a life size moving d image is projected in front of your eyes is still a fiction that you can only see in movies professor masahiro yamaguchi has spent years working on the acquisition of optical information reflected from objects as digital data and on interfaces to reproduce that information for human eyes we explore his work on this invisible yet remarkable path of light digitally creating holograms that surpass analog recording an object is visible when our eyes receive light reflected by the object when recording light an ordinary camera captures the intensity and wavelength color of the light but loses depth information holography is a technology that records and reproduces not only the intensity of light but also the information on how light travels as waves i e phase information hence it can capture and reconstruct an object as a d image including depth information the recorded medium taken with holography is called a hologram the inventor of holography dennis gabor received the nobel prize in physics in in the s when i was a fourth year undergraduate student it was common to create holograms by an analog process the area i chose as my research field the creation of holograms from digital data had just begun in the analog method since the object needs to be stable during recording under laser light illumination in a darkroom it is not possible to record large or soft objects and of course it is not possible to create holograms of virtual objects i thought that it would be a wonderful way to bring the image in my mind to reality as a d image if i could create a hologram from computer generated data for the digital holograms that i am currently researching it is necessary to calculate how light is reflected and propagated from objects in the real world so we employ a computer to perform a simulation of how light travels holograms created in this way are called computer generated holograms cgh but it is impossible with the methods established so far to fully simulate the complex behavior of light that interacts with various types of object surfaces and arrives at the hologram plane therefore we are currently researching a method to create elaborate holograms by incorporating cg technology and using two different representations of optical information light rays and waves in appropriate combinations the cgh of diamonds recently created using this method beautifully reproduces the luster brilliance and complex refraction of light ultimate reality one of the final destinations of holograms out of the types of information that humans receive from the real world the largest volume is optical information how can we digitize the light in the real world and reproduce it to human eyes it is a rewarding field where the results are truly visible masahiro yamaguchi department of information and communications engineering school of engineering professor laboratory website researcher profile he received his m s from tokyo institute of technology department of information processing interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering in he became a professor at the university s global scientific information and computing center in and has been at his current position since he received his ph d from tokyo institute of technology in november for about years from he was involved in research on natural color reproduction imaging systems using spectral technology as a sub leader of the akasaka natural vision research center at the national institute of information and communications technology he is currently promoting international collaborations related to spectroscopic imaging as a research forum rf convener of the international commission on illumination cie the holograms we make are mainly recorded as still images on glass plates or film displaying holograms on electronic displays requires over k pixels well beyond the current k and k so it has not yet been implemented in the real world if it can be achieved you will be able to enjoy a completely different visual experience from today s tvs with the naked eye my current goal is to reproduce a life size human being and the entire space of a room using digital holograms we are also conducting joint research with other research institutes and we have just completed a full sized human head today ar and vr worlds are expanding but what makes holograms special is that they allow you to sense a natural d space with the naked eye we will continue to study optical information in pursuit of truly realistic visual expression in d space what exactly is a hologram when you hear the word hologram you might imagine a d image floating in the air that s not wrong but the seemingly d computer generated characters you see at concerts are not created by holography but are d images using a transparent screen the most familiar hologram in japan is the rainbow colored part of the yen banknote the new yen and yen notes to be issued in will also have holograms that will make the portraits look d holography is even used in ar glasses holography is also used in augmented reality ar glasses that add new visual and text information to real world images the d image display in current ar glasses is not holography but holograms are used as an optical element that synthesizes real world scenes and the image from the projector in addition since conventional d images force an adjustment of the eye s focusing that is different from usual viewers are susceptible to eye fatigue applying holography which can perfectly reproduce the light emerging from an object will eventually enable a more natural visual experience a future where you can touch d aerial images development is underway on d user interfaces that are controlled by touching a d aerial image created by holography when you bring your finger to the d image a sensor detects the position where the finger touches the image and controls the system it is intuitive and easy to understand because you manipulate the image in the air directly the system is also effective in preventing dirt and infection because your finger does not touch a display now we just need to wait for its commercialization as a novel human computer interface humans do not perceive three dimensionality solely from the discrepancy between the vision of the left and right eyes the intrinsic value of holograms is to present the same optical information as the real objects to human eyes computer generated hologram of diamonds holography is a technology that records and reproduces phase information in addition to light intensity two different beams are required for recording the beam reflected from the object object beam and the beam that directly irradiates the recording medium without hitting the object reference beam a phenomenon called interference occurs in which the intensity of light changes due to the superimposition of the waves of the reference beam and the object beam the interference of light waves creates a very fine fringe pattern in the recording medium the medium on which the resulting interference fringes are recorded is a hologram when the hologram is illuminated by the beam from a light source placed at the same position as the reference beam at the time of recording the light is diffracted by the interference fringes of the hologram generating light traveling in a different direction the diffracted beam at this time has the same form as the recorded object beam based on this principle of holography the observer sees the d image as if the original object were behind the hologram even though the object is not really there holography was invented by hungarian born physicist dennis gabor in but it remained unnoticed for a long time because it did not produce clear images however the invention of the laser in improved the quality of reproduced images and holography has developed into a foundational technology hologram recording and image reconstruction seen from the optical path diagram of a laser beam hologram recording uses a laser that emits light of only one wavelength the emitted beam is separated by a half mirror into two beams one irradiates the object and the other directly irradiates the recording material reference beam then the reflected beam from the object object beam and the reference beam are superimposed and expose the recording medium the interference fringe of the object and reference beams is recorded in a hologram when reconstructing the hologram by irradiating the hologram with a laser beam from the same position as the reference beam in recording the light diffracted by the interference fringes of the hologram travels in the same way as the light emitted from the original object it therefore looks as if the original object is floating as a d image expanding applied research yamaguchi stands at the forefront of research on digital hologram production at the time i started my research people would display hundreds of computer generated images with a cathode ray tube record it on movie film and then expose it with a laser beam to create a hologram of image objects it was an incredibly time consuming task my first research topic was to create holograms by displaying images on lcd tvs instead of film our starting point of digitizing optical information has not changed but we also focus on a variety of applied research that has emerged during the research process reproducing colors as seen by the naked eye since a basic hologram utilizes the diffraction of light if sunlight or white light different in wavelength and direction from the reference beam is used as the reconstructing beam the d image will be blurred a rainbow hologram is a typical example that reproduces this by using the spectrum of light in the light spectrum the light is dispersed into different wavelength components so the reproduced image changes its color like a rainbow depending on the position of the eye it is printed on credit cards and banknotes as it is effective in preventing counterfeiting because it is difficult for third parties to duplicate as part of his applied research yamaguchi is developing image technology that makes full use of spectral information to capture and display images instead of the conventional rgb primary colors in color cameras and displays namely spectral imaging and multi primary color display if a camera can capture and display the spectrum of light it will be possible to capture colors and reproduce them exactly as seen by the naked eye on a display color reproduction technology with accurately capturing color texture and gloss of an object has the potential to make particularly significant contributions to medicine for example dermatologists need to distinguish slight color differences in lesions but normal commercial cameras correct the skin complexion and output images in beautiful colors representing it with spectral information allows for subtle shades to be correctly identified by applying image processing that enhances a specific wavelength component it is possible to emphasize the lesion also carrying a spectroscopic camera may dramatically improve the quality of telemedicine in sparsely populated or remote areas in addition to medicine the range of possible uses is expanding in many ways such as creating digital archives of artworks and cultural heritage and sharing the images of product prototypes yamaguchi next generation technology the lensless camera invented by dennis gabor holography was originally intended to capture and reproduce the properties of waves without a lens in order to create x ray and electron beam microscopes for which lenses cannot be used for this reason holograms are sometimes called lensless photography compact lightweight and capable of recording d information about objects the lensless camera has been in high demand in recent years as an image sensor for next generation ai it is actually an extension of hologram technology in march yamaguchi and his lab members announced a new image reconstruction method for lensless cameras using a cutting edge machine learning technique called a vision transformer vit this groundbreaking method speeds up the image processing of lensless cameras and enables the capture of high quality images lensless cameras have the potential to allow changing focus even after an image has been captured based on the optical information recorded the technology for reconstruction from captured images is the key there have already been attempts to apply deep learning which has been developing remarkably in recent years but it was not suitable for the special characteristics of the optical system of lensless cameras so sufficient performance was not achieved in the method we developed we focused on the fact that a vit can represent the characteristics of a lensless camera well and overcame that challenge yamaguchi based on optical imaging and image processing technology yamaguchi lab conducts a wide variety of research including multispectral imaging and lensless cameras all of their research is conducted to meet the needs of the times and yamaguchi says that he wants the technology to see the light of day imaging engineering enables us to express invisible information in a form that can be seen with the naked eye so we can experience the wonders of technology at a glance through the work of researchers like yamaguchi the ultimate image will one day cease to be a dream and will instead be projected right before our eyes innovative lensless camera awaiting real world implementation a lensless camera encodes the light emitted from a subject through a special sheet like mask instead of a lens and records it as a pattern on the sensor for cameras this technology offers miniaturization lower cost and higher functionality but processing has proven to be a challenge the new image processing method by yamaguchi lab has the potential to immediately bring lensless cameras to commercialization in the near future we may find ultra compact devices used in unprecedented applications throughout society lensless camera experimental setup of a lensless camera experimental setup for recording a hologram terms rays and waves a light ray is a concept in geometric optics

pursuits in language by humans and ai professor naoaki okazaki school of computing and yasumasa matsui tv asahi corporation news staff the world of language familiar yet profound humans and ai their roles in language and communication and what form our future world will take discussing these topics were professor naoaki okazaki who studies ais for manipulating language and yasumasa matsui tokyo tech alumnus former announcer and reporter human and ai approaches to convey news quickly and accurately okazaki my research focuses on technology for computers to understand and use human language this technology called natural language processing is used everywhere in our daily lives such as in ai assistants that answer people s questions and web services that translate texts into foreign languages it could be said that this research aims to achieve intelligent communication between humans and ai through language mr matsui you are truly an expert in language and communication why did you decide to become an announcer matsui actually it was my dream since elementary school the reason was that i admired a senior student who appeared on the classroom tv as an mc for a school broadcast when i was a student at tokyo tech i attended a broadcasting school and my dream came true when i joined tv asahi as an announcer after appearing on many broadcast programs i now work as a reporter in the news gathering center professor okazaki are there any technologies in your research that would be useful for news reporting okazaki yes for example there is a tool that generates headlines for newspaper articles this was achieved by using the technique of machine translation to train the ai on millions of sets of real newspaper articles and headlines teaching it how to translate long texts into short headlines now you can specify the number of characters for the headline enter the text of the article and instantly generate suggestions matsui it sounds like it can also be used for tickers displayed at the top of news programs very nice television and newspapers have their own particular expressions and wording depending on the medium can ai reflect that okazaki yes it can when trained on article data from the same newspaper company its features are mimicked in fact the accuracy has improved considerably and there are already examples of it being adopted in the real world however it is not able to output perfect sentences every time so the work of checking with the human eye is still necessary summarizing language a tool that automatically generates headlines for newspaper articles was completed three to four years ago ai reads a large number of articles and compares them with actual headlines to learn how to generate text matsui certainly whether you use the output as is depends on the situation but it is helpful as a reference as a matter of fact creating tickers for news programs is not an easy task what should be selected for just seconds or minute of news and how should it be conveyed in addition to summarizing information it is necessary to express the information taking into consideration information of high interest to viewers and differentiation from the reports of other stations that s both the difficulty and the fun of it tools that cover all these points of view may appear in the near future okazaki ai is good at summarizing but it will be difficult for the time being to make flexible decisions based on human psychology as you mentioned as you say the point is not to leave everything to ai but for people to think about how to use it the practical application of these tools poses another challenge that is namely the black box problem related to the reliability of ai the ai doesn t explain why it gave a particular answer i feel that it is important for researchers and developers to clearly explain the logic of ai in order to eliminate people s concerns about ai and to use it in various places in the real world announcing using correct japanese ai learning japanese through quantity okazaki we talked about how to convey information to viewers what else did you keep in mind as an announcer matsui first of all the starting point is to speak correct japanese and convey it to people pronunciation nasal sounds devoicing native japanese words and ra nuki words are rarely taught at school as a japanese language professional i am proud that the role of conveying information to many people is unique to an announcer in the world of ai how do you make japanese understood okazaki a computer is trained on a large amount of language data to capture the meaning of words and the structure of texts currently online articles blogs and snss are the main sources of supervision data the reason is that a huge amount of text can be collected relatively easily rather than learning the correct grammar and meaning of japanese you can imagine that the ai learns general usage and tendencies from numerous examples matsui i see the amount of data is important by the way among everyday words that ai learns there are quite a few words whose readings and meanings change due to people s misunderstandings for example the correct reading for the japanese word for dependence was ison but gradually more and more people read it as izon and the latter reading has become established although it is an irresistible trend i often say announcers should be the last line of defense even while keeping up with social trends the announcer should be the last to change i think we should not give up on continuing to communicate in the correct japanese of any point in time okazaki natural language processing is another field that studies how language evolves an announcer who communicates in correct japanese and an ai that grasps social trends from quantities of data i think that the different roles and purposes of each are reflected in their different approaches to language the importance of searching and thinking for yourself as revealed by sns matsui sns is also apparently used as learning data for ai but a certain kind of public opinion is formed on twitter is there any research that focuses on the language and opinions exchanged on sns okazaki after the great east japan earthquake i conducted research analyzing twitter discussions about peaches from fukushima prefecture as is well known fukushima s agricultural industry suffered a great deal of damage due to rumors associated with the nuclear accident in order to investigate the actual situation we used a method called sentiment analysis to follow tweets of the supporter and opposition groups for a given period of time and graphed them what became clear was that opinions do not change easily although supporter and opposition groups did retweet amongst each other there were almost no cases where they exchanged opinions and the number of people who changed their opinions was almost zero matsui they tend to only accept opinions that are the same as their own on twitter which is highly anonymous a wide variety of opinions fly back and forth including irresponsible remarks i often receive protests and complaints from anonymous viewers in the course of reporting i believe there is some truth in those opinions i believe that it is important to sift through the flood of claims and information in your own way as a reporter i do a lot of news gathering and if i can t make a decision i research until i m satisfied sometimes i use the network i have cultivated to ask for the opinions of experts the researching thinking and grasping appropriate information by yourself attitude is important even in today s internet society okazaki certainly i think that this attitude was a major requirement during the covid pandemic it was an unprecedented situation and the opinions of experts were divided it would be nice if we could make decisions based on listening to and understanding opinions from a variety of perspectives but there were many people who were swayed by their emotions and surroundings ai analyzes the opinions of supporter and opposition groups but cannot persuade beyond that i think people have no choice but to think and decide for themselves public opinion seen from sns ai analyzes negative and positive retweets about peaches from fukushima prefecture and visually expresses them opinions in each group visibly solidified but there was one case in which a person changed to the supporter group after actually eating a peach okazaki laboratory conducts various research using ai including this kind of emotion opinion analysis news gathering to approach the truth when i was in charge of the nuclear power plant issue as an announcer i experienced the great east japan earthquake while personally reporting on the nuclear fuel cycle system in rokkasho village aomori currently as a reporter in charge of weather disasters i am acquiring deeper knowledge of earthquakes and volcanoes while collaborating with professors at tokyo tech will announcers and ai coexist future projections for language and technology okazaki in recent years the accuracy of machine translation has improved dramatically so we believe that the number of situations where ai will produce words and texts will increase and the world will accept it to some extent even though the headline generation tool mentioned earlier is inadequate it will likely be used in media that transmit a large amount of information the creation of creative texts for which ai is not good at the moment should also be further researched and developed matsui hearing you say that i think that announcers and ai will naturally coexist in the near future we actually have an ai announcer at our company but at this stage it s just a venture investment however the day will soon come when it will be impossible to tell whether a person is speaking or an ai however for the time being roles such as moderating for a show giving closing remarks and creating a script from scratch remain the work of humans it will take some time for ai to learn to pick up on the subtleties of a person s emotions and incorporate them into unconventional conversations and expressions but i don t think it will be too far in the future okazaki i agree as researchers we must improve performance to meet a wide range of needs and produce more accurate output the general public who are the users also need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of ai rather than just blindly believe in it on top of that i think it would be good if we could effectively divide roles matsui that means having the knowledge and ai literacy to use it correctly after all i thought that any field ultimately depends on how people use it ai and announcers i am very excited to think that after each of us has evolved and studied hard a future of collaborating may be on the horizon still a long way to go deepening intellectual curiosity language processing with the recent evolution and spread of ai an increasing number of people want to learn language processing okazaki has released a collection of exercises titled nlp exercise for free online it is a mechanism for acquiring the necessary programming and data analysis skills through solving problems an open exchange of knowledge is taking place with many people taking on the challenge and releasing examples of solutions japanese language one of the reasons why japanese is changing is people s assumptions the words yoron and seron which originally had different meanings are used together for the japanese word for public opinion when the wrong usage becomes the majority usage newspaper companies and broadcasting stations revise their rules and the correct reading and meaning change what kind of language will you convey in just seconds of news we need expressions that capture the essence of information and move people yasumasa matsui tv asahi

genome editing paving new paths in industry professor yuriko osakabe school of life science and technology technology that creates the world genome editing technology edits the genome genetic information which is the biological blueprint to change the traits of an organism as desired it has recently been in the global spotlight due to its wide ranging fields of application professor yuriko osakabe engages in fundamental research for genome editing technology and developed a novel domestic genome editing tool welcome to a world of dramatically advancing technology that unlocks new possibilities for life revolutionary genome editing tool tid all living organisms have a genome although there are differences in the number of genes it contains which determines their appearance physiological characteristics and biology genome editing technology induces the expression of different traits by changing only the targeted dna of the genome two researchers who worked on the current mainstream genome editing tool crispr cas won the nobel prize in chemistry in my research in the field of genetic engineering has progressed along with changes in genome editing technology i started my research in the s when the term genome editing did not even exist subsequently the development of editing tools progressed rapidly around the world and crispr cas appeared in the s as a result of our vigorous efforts to develop and demonstrate a novel method we finally developed the world s first novel genome editing tool tid and successfully applied for a patent in august what makes tid special is that the incidence of off target effects in which the base sequence of non target dna is edited which was an issue with crispr cas is extremely low my current focus is detailed research aimed at the practical application of tid possibilities for genome editing technology via industrial applications we will clarify one by one why organisms live and why they have a variety of functions and find clues to solving social problems it is a field of research where you truly feel that your own discoveries will contribute to the world yuriko osakabe department of life science and technology school of life science and technology professor about the laboratory researcher profile in completed a master s degree at graduate school of agriculture the university of tokyo in completed a doctoral degree at the united graduate school of agricultural science tokyo university of agriculture and technology doctor of agricultural science tokyo university of agriculture and technology involved in the development of tid as part of the smart cell project by the new energy and industrial technology development organization nedo tid has expanded the applications of genome editing technology in a major way this is because the high accuracy of editing will lead to the adoption of genome editing technology in medicine and drug discovery which has been challenging in terms of safety if tid can be put to practical use it will provide a hopeful prospect for the treatment of serious genetic diseases and intractable diseases such as cancer and cell therapies applications for ips cells and virus detection are also envisioned of course it can also be applied to other familiar industries for example its adoption in the field of reusable bioresource development made from plants and microorganisms could greatly improve production efficiency and solve the energy problem using it for breed improvement in the agricultural and livestock industry could solve food problems by developing breeds with high nutritional value acquiring resistance to environmental stress and increasing yields genome editing technology including tid which is now in the global spotlight has the potential to produce solutions to complex social problems applications in medicine the pinpoint repair of faulty genes will likely lead to gene therapies for hereditary diseases cell therapies to edit patient cells and the discovery of novel cancer treatments applications for drug discovery in addition to helping to streamline the drug making process applications have also been found that improve the safety of vaccines administered to humans and animals applications for bioresource development enabling the production of cells with advanced functional design has also promoted the increased production of bioresources and the development of high added value resources applications in agriculture livestock and fisheries its use in breeding has led to the development of highly nutritious agricultural and livestock products large farmed fish that can help solve food problems and plants that can grow in harsh environments old friends sometimes ask me if research is a struggle but for me the fun always wins out over the hardships the experiments involve plants so perseverance is required but once you have experienced the excitement of the moment when your hypothesis is proven there will be no stopping you i will never forget the thrill of being a researcher who unravels the unexplained and will continue to explore the principles of life decipher and use biological blueprint organisms all have a species specific genome for a long time humankind has puzzled over how to decipher and use this biological blueprint a genome is the set of genes that an organism has in the human genome was successfully deciphered after years of work and the genome decipherment of many organisms is still underway once we learned about the base sequences that make up the dna of a genome and the functions of genes the idea arose to see if we could use that information to overcome existing problems or make better use of it that is the origin of genome editing which changes the function of genes osakabe genome editing is a technology that edits the base sequence of dna and changes the functions of genes precisely as intended the principle behind genome editing is to first cause a dna double strand break at a specific part with an artificial enzyme nuclease also called molecular scissors then mutations caused by repair errors that occur when organisms repair the break are used to change traits in fact mutations themselves are a frequently occurring phenomenon in the natural world and genome editing can be visualized as artificially flipping a switch to make it happen in other words this technology is probably close to a natural law the history of genome editing technology is the trajectory of the development of artificial nucleases that is enzymes that are artificially modified to degrade dna and the development of technologies that optimize these genome editing tools for application in living organisms early genome editing tools zfns were developed in the late s followed by talens and in crispr cas used today as a standard worldwide was first reported genome editing as a dna repair mechanism genome editing employs the method of introducing mutations knock out by utilizing the fact that three patterns of repair errors indels occur around the site of dna double strand breakage deletion of base substitution with another base and insertion of another base alternatively scientists use the method of rewriting a dna sequence by inserting donor dna and copying the base sequence during repair knock in researchers around the world have accepted the challenge of developing genome editing tools that are more accurate and easier to use and new ones have been developed one after another crispr cas currently the mainstream tool is easy to produce and anyone can use it for fundamental research so the possibilities of applying genome editing in various fields have suddenly expanded a so called biotech revolution but there are still hurdles to cross genome editing using crispr cas carries the risk of editing unintended genes crispr cas identifies the target base sequence binds to that part and cleaves the dna crispr cas may mistakenly bind to or cleave parts of a similar base sequence existing in the genome resulting in the introduction of mutations in that situation there are cases where the gene does not work as desired and it becomes necessary to remove these mutations this is an off target effect and is one of the challenges to overcome in order to utilize genome editing in the fields of medicine and drug discovery the world s first novel genome editing tool that can significantly mitigate this off target effect is tid developed by osakabe and others tid has an order of magnitude lower risk of editing unintended genes than conventional tools the reason is that it identifies longer sequences than crispr cas crispr cas uses a base sequence whereas tid uses a or base sequence to identify edit sites so the probability of a similar sequence existing in the genome is very low this allows for precise target identification and reduces the risk of off target mutations and deletions because of this unique feature tid has paved the path for genome editing to expand into medicine and drug discovery among other industrial applications most existing genome editing technologies including crispr cas were developed in europe and the united states and their commercial use in japan raises issues with intellectual property rights since tid is domestically produced it is also attractive for reducing the costs of using foreign patents the real world implementation of tid will undoubtedly serve as a foothold for the promotion of an independent japanese industry that applies genome editing issues at hand off target effects crispr cas searches for and binds to specific bases out of hundreds of millions of base pairs in living organisms however if there are similar sequences in the genome that differ by only one or two out of the bases it may bind incorrectly this is the off target effect the real world implementation of genome editing technology requires not only optimization of technology according to individual organisms but also cell regeneration to demonstrate normal expression of desired traits in edited organisms and peripheral technologies such as genome analysis to determine where and how to edit in the base sequence of the target organism for example in the world of plants one of my research subjects there is still much to do in genome analysis of various plant species and cultivars and many issues remain such as there being species for which tissue culture and plant regeneration have not succeeded over many years genetic engineering researchers must also tackle these issues we are accumulating interdisciplinary knowledge with researchers from other fields which should lead to new achievements in the near future osakabe tid is expected to change the landscape of japanese genome editing technology and research is currently underway with the aim of real world implementation in collaboration with tokushima university which is jointly developing the technology and companies conducting various research using tid technology osakabe is pouring effort into this we are striving daily for the practical application of tid which has potential in various fields such as medicine drug discovery bioresource development and improvement of food species we would like to get the necessary basic technologies ready so that we can contribute to solving social problems where complex fields are intertwined genome editing technology holds great power researchers will continue to discuss how to use it properly and devise methods that will be useful to people and society the young genetic engineering researchers at osakabe laboratory are advancing their research step by step and at the same time gradually realizing the social significance of their fundamental research dreaming of the day when we unravel the mysteries of life and design new forms of life terms genome genetic information the genetic information of all dna deoxyribonucleic acid contained in an organism which shapes the organism and is necessary for life activities the information in the dna of a genome that specifies the order of amino acids when making a protein for a living organism is called a gene crispr cas a genome editing tool that uses the immune system of bacteria to cleave dna double strands and introduce mutations at arbitrary sites in dna it is characterized by using rna molecules to identify dna sequences and has the advantage of being simpler and less costly than conventional tools such as zfns and talens base sequence dna forms a double helix structure by pairing at the bases of nucleotide molecules genetic information is represented by a sequence composed of four base types a adenine t thymine g guanine and c cytosine school of life science and technology unravel the complex and

opera meets ultrasound understanding sound from different perspectives sound is everywhere in our daily lives its types range from musical performances and singing voices to the sounds of nature noise and ultrasound here is a talk on sound between jun takahashi a singer tenor who has performed in numerous operas and professor kentaro nakamura who conducts cutting edge research on ultrasound insights from different fields will help to unravel the potential of sound what is the relationship between audible music and inaudible ultrasound takahashi i am a singer and i am very much looking forward to hearing about sound from a scientific point of view please tell us what ultrasound is nakamura first of all a sound is a vibration of air and its number of vibrations frequency corresponds to the pitch of the sound that a person senses humans can hear frequencies from to hz sounds with higher frequencies are called ultrasound ultrasound has a wide range of applications such as automobile sensors and medical diagnostic equipment as well as applications for cleaning cutting and bonding in the industrial sector the eyeglass cleaner at the optician is an example takahashi even in my work as a singer there are many situations where i am aware of the existence of sound waves at the college of music i learned about the doppler effect in acoustics course and while learning the musical scale i learned about the system of harmonics when making a cd sounds that humans cannot perceive are omitted but some say that live performances sound richer because they retain these sound waves what are harmonics a sound that is a whole number multiple of the frequency that is generated in addition to the fundamental frequency when a sound is emitted the way harmonics are generated determines the effect of the sound nakamura that s an interesting point of view my research has made me realize that there is a discrepancy between measurement results and human senses for example even if the measured values indicate that the sound level has doubled humans do not perceive the difference as double digital audio can take advantage of these properties in recording to reduce the data volume it may be a musician s point of view that live performances that include all sounds are richer as someone who has refined their senses what kind of concert hall do you find is good to perform in takahashi the acoustic design of concert halls has a long history and the concert hall made by minoru nagata founder of nagata acoustics is especially famous he worked on suntory hall which achieved the optimum reverberation time for concerts of seconds causing a stir i can sing freely in this kind of carefully constructed concert hall without being conscious of the size of the space a good concert hall is a place where the performer can perform anywhere on the stage without strain the fine nuances reach the audience it brings out the vibrance of the performance to make the sounds resonate well it is also important to use your body well not only your throat but also the whole of your body as a space where sounds resonate affects your performance expression significantly nakamura you use the concert hall as an extension of your body to make the sounds resonate even ultrasound research stresses how to make sounds resonate when producing strong sound waves dimensions are a rough indication of that changing the size of objects and spaces that vibrate in response to sound waves modifies how sounds resonate takahashi being able to grasp how sound resonates through numerical values is different from music performances that only have perfect sound intensity have an unsatisfying effect on the audience of course accurate playing skills are necessary but more important is having an interpretation that you want to express this leads to rich music that resonates in people s hearts the power of sound refined by measuring and listening takahashi sound is a blessing to the world in various ways but in music i think it makes a great contribution to spiritual richness good music not only heals but also conveys the emotions and breathing of the performer as well as the underlying psychology in europe where music is a part of life concerts have been held even in wartime i think this fact can be gleaned from european culture which values people s peace of mind on the other hand your sounds have been polished with an eye toward practical real world use nakamura yes that s right ultrasound technology is used for joining plastic containers containing prepared foods found in supermarkets cutting cakes at pastry factories and for cataract and prostate cancer surgeries ultrasound plays an important role in every aspect of our lives in addition precise measurements are required to fully demonstrate its effect ultrasonic waves have a high frequency and a short wavelength so they cannot be measured correctly with a normal microphone therefore we have developed a new microphone that is as thin as hair and we are working on measurements takahashi i also recognize the importance of verification to obtain good results music is about listening not measuring but training is indispensable for improving this skill as an example there is a basic training method called solf ge where you gradually acquire a sharp sense through the experience of reading a score and playing its sound in practice listening to a sound and transcribing it on a score nakamura people are involved in the entire process of playing listening to and evaluating music so it is difficult to make a uniform judgment i have also heard that when there s a problem with noise it is effective to promote communication between the parties concerned in addition to physical countermeasures takahashi certainly if your impression of the person making the sounds changes dissatisfaction and anger may fade away both the music we create and the many industrial products that have incorporated your research will eventually reach people in every field i think it s indispensable to have a perspective on how to be there for people and help them touching the real thing leads to learning in both ultrasound and music nakamura in terms of reaching people you have other interactions with students as a lecturer at the tokyo college of music in addition to your role as a singer is there anything that you are particularly careful about when teaching takahashi when i teach i am conscious of not only demonstrating but also communicating in words even if a teacher sings something in practice it is not always possible for students of different sexes and physiques to reproduce it according to the model i think a concrete image through words is necessary in order for people to understand sensory things also since opera has a style inherited from predecessors students need to experience various performances learn the history of music put it into practice yourself and output it as a new expression i think that the independence and spirit that are nurtured in the process will be the basis for playing an active role in society nakamura as an educator i really sympathize with what you are saying what i have repeatedly told the students in my laboratory is that i want them to observe physical phenomena in practice and deepen their understanding through their own senses even if you read textbooks and academic papers it is meaningless unless you can connect that knowledge with the phenomena right in front of your eyes i want them to develop a sense of what will be useful in future manufacturing through various experiences how sound reaches you the idea of speaking is actually close to that of a ball game if you try to forcibly say something loudly it will put a strain on your throat so the key point is to sing so that the sound resonates with your own body it is also called the bel canto singing method and is often conveyed by expressions such as letting sounds fly or throwing sounds learn through real experience real experience linked to knowledge is key at nakamura lab the laboratory is lined with equipment that allows students to conduct research through trial and error it is full of ideas and ingenuity such as an experimental device that uses sound waves to determine the presence of people in a room and a technology that uses ultrasound to remove stains and raindrops on glass surfaces exploiting the possibilities of humans and sound will lead to an unimaginable future takahashi teamwork is also important to bring out the results of these efforts in the case of music especially in choruses and orchestras the ability to listen is essential to building teamwork better performances can be achieved by listening carefully to match pitch and pronunciation and being attentive to eye contact in fact it is even said that conductors need the ability to capture hearts more than the ability to swing a baton nakamura oh i see in engineering research individual ideas and hard work are often the starting point but the process of actually making something useful to the world is a team battle most of the time once you re a member of society you ll get things done as a member of an organization when people with different values come together and work as one something valuable will be created that lifts people s hearts and lives takahashi that s right and we believe that the mission of a singer is to pursue the value transferred from one living person to another recently speech synthesis technology and online distribution have spread rapidly but there is still room for growth in human mediated analog expression if you can fully exploit its appeal the expression will be wonderful nakamura i m looking forward to that the amount of information that sound has including the music that you are involved in is extremely rich visual media often gets the spotlight but i think that sound contains a wealth of information that is just as impressive for example the number of pixels in displays is increasing but the basic components are the three primary colors of red green and blue only as for sound the number of speakers is not as large as the number of pixels but the frequency and dynamic range of the sounds are orders of magnitude greater than those of the visual sense also visual information can be blocked by closing your eyes but sound can be heard to some extent even if your ears are closed i think that sound has infinite possibilities including its inconveniences takahashi sounds with unique characteristics and the emotions of humans that perform them it s my eternal desire to link the two the seeds of research are endless for both of us still a long way to go deepening intellectual curiosity ultrasound various attempts have been made utilizing the energy of ultrasound there is a technology photo that floats a liquid or a small object in a sound wave node and it is also possible to make the surface of metal slimy like mud with minute vibrations of ultrasonic waves be attentive to various inaudible invisible phenomena caused by ultrasound vocal music to make your voice resonate it is important to resonate your entire body especially in opera s classical vocalization the burden on the throat is reduced by conceiving of the head and chest as a room or hall head voice chest voice and being aware of the space inside each human body structure in addition understanding the voice as a line rather than a surface and having the awareness of reaching each member of the audience will lead to improved expressive ability various sound waves unique to live music their existence mysteriously enriches the color of the music itself various sound waves unique to live music their existence mysteriously enriches the color of the music itself jun takahashi singer tenor born in saitama prefecture graduated from the tokyo college of music and completed a master s degree at its graduate school recognized for his incredibly beautiful voice and power of expression he has performed at the world premiere and japan premiere of numerous opera works currently he is also active as a lecturer at the tokyo college of music member of singer group nikikai there is a difference between mechanical measurement and human senses that difference is the challenge and thrill

traveling through time to the first second after the birth of the universe geek creates the world how was this universe of ours born the key to unraveling this profound mystery is neutrinos one of the elementary particles that make up matter professor masahiro kuze is working on international joint research with a state of the art high energy accelerator to prove cp violation in neutrinos which is a clue welcome to the dynamic world of geek which is closing in on one second after the birth of the universe research on the infinitesimal neutrino reveals the origin of the universe mankind has been pursuing the smallest unit of matter since ancient greek times it was once revealed that an atom which is decomposed into electrons protons and neutrons can be further decomposed with protons and neutrons being composed of three smaller particles called quarks particle physics began by pursuing and elucidating such a minimum unit my research activities also began with my involvement in research with accelerators at a german research institute to elucidate the internal structure of protons since i have participated in the atlas experiment using the lhc large hadron collider highest energy level in the world at cern european organization for nuclear research in switzerland and contributed to the discovery of the higgs boson which is the origin of the mass of elementary particles at the same time i expanded my research to neutrino experiments and am working on research to capture a phenomenon called neutrino oscillation in which neutrinos change their appearance as they fly using the super kamiokande detector in gifu prefecture what is interesting about neutrino research is the dynamic approach to the birth mystery the origin of the universe the process of gradually revealing what happened in the first second after birth is in a sense like going back to the big bang in a time machine and repeating miniature experiments a child s mind drives towards the discovery of the century the events immediately after the big bang billion years ago are gradually becoming clear it s very dynamic research that closes in on the roots of our creation masahiro kuze department of physics school of science professor laboratory website researcher profile in completed a doctoral degree program in the department of physics at the school of science the university of tokyo became a professor at the school of science tokyo tech doctor of science university of tokyo he is involved in the atlas experiment of cern european organization for nuclear research the t k experiment by japan proton accelerator research complex j parc and super kamiokande and the hyper kamiokande project since elementary particle research is very expensive many countries pool funding to conduct international joint research people of different ages and nationalities gather together with the one goal of unraveling the mysteries of the universe this makes the joy of seeing totally original data priceless in retrospect my roots are in the space themed television show i saw in high school learning about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and about voyager which has records containing information on humankind i became very interested in the universe seeing researchers forgetting to eat and sleep and immersing themselves in experiments they all seem to retain the pure curiosity they had as a child with that curiosity we see eye to eye even if our circumstances are different and we can overcome failed experiments cherishing pure curiosity i would like to continue to close in on the mysteries of the universe what happened in the first second after the birth of the universe billion years ago shortly after the birth of the universe through the big bang matter and antimatter were born theoretically the two were supposed to cause annihilation and disappear but the matter apparently remained due to a slight asymmetry caused by the interaction cp violation and formed the present universe how do you measure the mass of neutrinos the standard model of particle physics has postulated that the mass of a neutrino is but research at super kamiokande has found that it has a mass we observed atmospheric neutrinos pouring down from space and obtained evidence by comparing the numbers from the other side of the earth with the numbers from above dark matter does exist space observations such as the rotation speed of galaxies and the gravitational lens effect make it clear that the amount of mass far exceeds the mass of matter visible as celestial bodies in the universe and dark matter is presumably responsible for that mass it is an important substance that occupies about of the universe but it cannot be explained by the particles currently known in particle physics its identity is still unknown about billion neutrinos arriving from the sun pass through the tip of your finger in one second despite that only about can currently be detected in a day c kamioka observatory icrr institute for cosmic ray research the university of tokyo in the world of particle physics there is a body of theory called the standard model it describes how the electromagnetic force the strong force and the weak force the three forces acting between elementary particles interact with each other and one mathematical formula can explain most of the physical phenomena related to elementary particles however the standard model is not perfect and there are some phenomena which it cannot explain one of them is the existence of neutrino mass in fact neutrinos in the standard model have no mass at all however the discovery of neutrino oscillations changing neutrino type over time has confirmed that it has a small mass kuze explains these flaws in the standard model are stepping stones to establish a larger body of theory the mass of neutrinos is currently the only proven flaw this is the reason why researchers around the world are paying attention to neutrinos and actively conducting international joint research one of them is the japan led t k experiment using the super kamiokande detector in the kamioka mine in hida city gifu prefecture and it is a world leader among the many joint research projects at j parc high intensity proton accelerator facility in tokai village ibaraki prefecture the goal is to shoot an artificially generated neutrino beam into super kamiokande about km away and measure the neutrino oscillations in detail the accelerator can generate both neutrinos and the antineutrino beams that are opposite each other if the two neutrino oscillations are measured and a difference in behavior appears it is evidence that cp violation has occurred the t k experiment is progressing smoothly and in the range of values that the cp phase angle determines the magnitude of the difference in behavior between neutrinos and antineutrinos can take was narrowed down to nearly half this let us show cp violation with confidence kuze the world of elementary particles seen from the standard model elementary particles consist of the elementary particles quarks and leptons that form matter gauge bosons that transmit force and higgs boson that gives mass to elementary particles a neutrino is a kind of lepton and there are three types an electron neutrino muon neutrino and tau neutrino in the world of particle physics a probability of is evidence and a probability of is a discovery while pursuing evidence of cp violation through t k experiments there are also new projects to accelerate research hyper kamiokande is scheduled to start experiments in by constructing a facility with an effective volume about times that of super kamiokande and strengthening the beam from tokai village we aim to acquire data about times faster approximately researchers from countries are scheduled to participate in experiments using hyper kamiokande and japan is truly a mecca for elementary particle research the discovery of the century is near current status of the t k experiment taking advantage of the nature of neutrinos which penetrate even the earth t k is a profound experiment in which neutrinos generated by the accelerator in tokai village are beamed to super kamiokande in hida city and detected there the cp violation of quarks found to date is small and cannot explain the amount of matter in the universe however the t k experiment suggests that the cp symmetry of neutrinos may be severely violated the measurement of cp phase angle will likely be a clue to unraveling the fundamental mysteries of the universe kuze explains why japan is leading the way in particle physics the existence of kamiokande the unique experimental facility in the world is significant kamiokande originated from physics nobel prize winner dr masatoshi koshiba s unusual idea it has nurtured many researchers and made japan a major particle research nation neutrinos are so difficult to detect that they are called ghost particles there are multiple methods using nuclear reactors and antarctic ice but kamiokande adopted the unique idea of creating a huge space in a deep underground mine site with little cosmic ray noise and installing a huge tank filled with pure water which is the cheapest available this unusual idea actually bolstered japan s current breakthrough because the difficulty level is very high an individual s unusual idea can work out that is the real thrill of neutrino research kuze large scale research using accelerators and hyper kamiokande is called big science and many researchers from all over the world participate researchers divide up roles such as development of observation equipment and data analysis accumulate data over decades and combine it to produce results although students are only involved in one part of the project professor kuze says that the significance of being involved in big science is great under the big idea of closing in on the mysteries of the universe it is an invaluable experience for everyone to work together toward this one goal also discussing these ideas with other researchers provides you with a broader perspective the heritage of japanese particle physics has been passed down through time the students who gather in the kuze laboratory are also enthusiastic about their daily research indeed time travel to one second after the birth of the universe is coming ever closer construction of the next generation hyper kamiokande hyper kamiokande is currently under construction with the aim of starting experiments in students in kuze laboratory are in charge of developing electronic circuits that process the signals of optical sensors their design is proceeding with consideration to failure prevention stability energy efficiency and other aspects while facing the challenge of being submerged in pure water terms cp violation c stands for charge transformation swapping particles and antiparticles and p stands for parity transformation swapping vertical and horizontal orientations with respect to space like a mirror image when the same physical phenomenon occurs with the same probability when this c transformation and p transformation are performed it is called cp symmetry and when it does not conform to these conditions it is said that cp symmetry is violated cp phase angle it is a value that determines the magnitude of cp violation and is one of the basic properties of neutrinos the cp phase angle can range from degrees to degrees if the cp phase angle is degree or degrees cp symmetry is preserved otherwise it indicates that cp symmetry is violated pure water since faint light must be observed to find neutrinos pure water with as little dirt and impurities as possible is required kamioka in gifu prefecture is capable of providing abundant water which is one of the reasons why it was selected as the location for kamiokande school of science exploring the truth and creating knowledge

recycling an interdisciplinary science the future of waste recycling as considered through both the sciences and humanities the modern world is filled with things and waste treatment has become a social problem associate professor fumitake takahashi is researching the possibilities and risks in recycling an indispensable task as we move towards a recycling based society why is it that recycling has been slow to progress by focusing on the issue from the viewpoints of both science and society takahashi s research is providing unique insight into solving waste recycling giving recycled products added value fumitake takahashi doctor of engineering associate professor department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society laboratory researcher profile recommended book tokeigaku nyumon kiso tokeigaku i introduction to statistics basic statistics i edited by statistics section department of social sciences college of arts and sciences the university of tokyo it is hard to predict how much of what you learn in university will be useful in life statistics however is a basic element that will be useful in any case of thinking this book will be advantageous to your career building and bring great returns for your effort wastes contain hazardous materials such as heavy metals and toxic elements must be immobilized before recycling however despite advances in the development of immobilization technology recycling has not progressed much takahashi took a different path and decided to pursue adding value to motivate people to use recycled products his first attempt was when he was at kyushu university when wastes are melted at temperatures above degrees a glass like substance is produced called slag and the slag that is produced when smelting and refining steel contains fluoride to solidify this fluoride what occurred to me was toothpaste containing fluoride when fluoride is added to hydroxyapatite it becomes fluorapatite and prevents tooth decay i applied that principle to slag takahashi takahashi synthesized fluorapatite on the surface of the slag imitating a tooth surface and attempted to endow the slag with an environmental remediation function owing to the activity of microorganisms that attach themselves to it he says that this is when he started his research into adding value later at tokyo tech he began research on recycling coal fly ash with an international student from china coal fired power is the main source of electricity in china and the resulting coal fly ash is causing pollution further much of where coal can be mined is arid and desertification and land degradation are advancing if coal fly ash could be turned into a material that retains water in soil it could be recycled while helping to solve an environmental problem at the core is the idea to take something and to create a cycle for it there where it already is this concept of developing technology to add value has led him to other solutions such as porous geopolymeric adsorbents that retain water and materials that adsorb heavy metals and other hazardous materials porous geopolymeric material containing coal fly ash it has countless pores on its surface to adsorb water initially coal fly ash was used after processing its surface to immobilize toxic elements but since coal fly ash particles are fine in size retrieval was difficult once the ash had been scattered since the geopolymeric form is a larger solid it can be easily sifted out for retrieval the psychological burden of removing a bottle cap is yen immobilizing toxic elements from and adding value to recycled material are scientific approaches takahashi does not stop there as he emphasizes the need for a social science perspective of human behavior and on negative psychological impressions about recycling what is the primary psychological factor holding back recycling he focuses on the idea of psychological burden he is quantifying this psychological burden through his research and converting it into monetary value environmental economics has a method of measuring psychological burden it s called willingness to pay and it can be converted into a monetary value by asking how much would you pay to have someone else do what you feel is a burden but i felt that this price does not adequately portray the reality when derived from the principle of supply and demand and i searched for a different way to fairly compare psychological burdens there are two steps to this method first psychological burdens are compared and the data is converted to numerical values for example asking people which is more of a burden to remove the caps from plastic bottles or to make curry will produce data on selectivity then applying statistical processing will convert this to a value next the quantified psychological burden is converted into a monetary value many services and products in society are for avoiding psychological burdens for example the answer to making curry is prepared curry sold in plastic pouches based on its market price which has been determined based on supply and demand the monetary value of the psychological burden can be calculated the psychological burden of removing bottle caps is yen and of rinsing the bottles is yen says takahashi plastic bottle recycling requires four actions of people removing the cap removing the label rinsing and crushing this means that collected bottles could be in any of the states arising from cap removed or not label removed or not rinsed or not and crushed or not after takahashi s arrival at tokyo tech he and his students examined approximately plastic bottles and made an interesting discovery the rates of label removal and rinsing were low among people who did not remove the caps but the rates of subsequent actions were high among people who did remove the caps my interpretation is that people can be sifted apart by a psychological burden of yen for example bottles placed in a collection box located at a major supermarket do not have caps or labels and are rinsed they are high in quality the psychological burden of taking the bottles to a supermarket is to yen when appraised using willingness to pay but according to my method it is yen since burdens are being compared with one another i think it is also capturing the psychological burden that is being felt subconsciously i think we can say that recycling is important to people who can rise above this yen the horizon that opened up and the strengths that increased because of changing themes takahashi s research as a student was in waste liquid treatment using supercritical water water at high temperatures and pressures though he sought employment at the national institute for environmental studies he was forced to change his research theme when i look back on it now i think this was a very positive development laughs takahashi at the national institute for environmental studies he began research on finding the amount of mercury released into the atmosphere and concurrently research on recycling molten slag this was his first step into recycling research he worked on a study to mix slag into asphalt for use as roadbed material after moving to kyushu university under professor takayuki shimaoka he studied landfills and the properties of ash and researched ways to use ash as an ingredient of cement the research on mercury is ongoing and following the amount released into the atmosphere what is being studied now is the environmental risk following safe burial by stratum disposal the common path in research is to master one thing as for recycling however we need multifaceted viewpoints and thinking including value addition psychological motivation risk analysis and safety of landfills and i came to consciously take a multifaceted approach i think it helped that i had changed my research theme after obtaining my doctorate that experience lowered the psychological hurdle for me anyone who s specializing in a field and laboring in it realizes how hard it is for another to get into that field tackling problems in an interdisciplinary way combining both the sciences and arts is a signature of takahashi this strength is being put to full use in recycling research an interdisciplinary study that requires both engineering and social science design can empower the world to improve when i was at kyushu university i happened to glance at the laboratory s waste receptacles and the contents were not sorted well his first idea was that this was caused by municipalities having different collection systems however studying it led to the conclusion that in reality collection systems did not have much effect on wrong matter being mixed in takahashi now has a laboratory at tokyo tech and is including more and more into his vision spanning more fields his research has developed into applying the quantification of psychological burden to measure design quality i believe that changing the design of waste receptacles can improve sorting and that there must be a better design for sorting charts as well but i would like to collaborate with governments or private companies in such proposals that would be implemented in communities and right now we are sowing seeds to that end students are also tasked with exercises such as considering waste receptacle designs that promote the removal of bottle caps and prevent the inclusion of other matter before covid we had set some up at ookayama campus as experiments on collection one had a lane attached to the waste receptacle and when a cap was rolled into it it would provide a bit of fortune telling another had a basketball net for caps to be thrown into when we added such play inviting people be part of the action the cap removal rate became the students kept coming up with ideas to get past the yen of psychological burden and i was impressed by the power of youth takahashi smiles warmly his teaching style values the autonomy of students he watches over the research of students interested in recycling as well as those interested in design and it while still maintaining focus on the expansion of his own research voice kei soyama nd year master s student department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society graduate major in global engineering for development environment and society recommended book bunsan bunseki no hanashi about analysis of variance by sadao ishimura i want to explore presentation slide design and make use of it in the future i am researching the design of slides used in presentations even if the content stays the same how does comprehension change with a different layout or when a diagram is moved to a different location what sort of design do people tend to like i use surveys to collect and analyze responses and draw conclusions i chose this laboratory because i was interested in takahashi sensei s work of quantifying how people feel and because i was drawn to him as a person who uses clear english to present interesting ideas slides are used in companies and in research so i feel that studying them will prove useful i would like to make use of my outcomes and my english skills in my future career douglas hungwe rd year doctoral student department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society graduate major in global engineering for development environment and society recommended book obliquity by john kay i want to further my research in recycling and one day guide my country to a solution to its waste problem the international quality of takahashi lab appealed to me it had many international students and it was possible to interact with others in english my homeland zimbabwe has a serious waste problem and i chose to study recycling because i want to solve it my research is on making fuel by heat treating tires and biomass i am studying the basics now but what we must deal with is massive and i am eager to continue on to applied research takahashi sensei values what each student wants to do

the future of the virtual and the real the new world of design for virtual and real experiences tokyo tech alumna chiharu kodama is a designer and art director who believes that the world can be made better with the power of design school of engineering associate professor yoshihiro watanabe comprehends the instants that human eyes cannot perceive and works with control technology on dynamic projection mapping the two got together to discuss this new era in design in which relationships humans and computers the virtual and the real time and distance are changing interview held on june at the suzukakedai campus dynamic projection mapping proposed by associate professor watanabe projects images onto the surfaces of even moving objects without latency can change the appearance of surface material and even create shadows models used in experiments are a figure of a rabbit and a human which make it easier to view the projection of surface irregularities the texture and color that stay in place on the object even when the object is moved appear as if they are truly of the material ordinary television cameras are capable of to fps used here however are cameras that can capture at fps and projectors that are among the fastest in the world and can project at a maximum of fps with these the lab has achieved latency so low that it is not visually perceptible the figure of a rabbit called the stanford bunny is a test model for computer graphics that was developed at stanford university in because of its geometric complexity and the number of triangular elements when the model is read into a d scanner it is a common choice of test model for many types of d graphic data commonalities between design to reach hearts and research to understand watanabe you were already interested in and working with design when you were an undergraduate at tokyo tech and that has led to what you are doing today becoming a designer after graduating from tokyo tech is not a common career path how do you feel about where you are now kodama there was no precedent of a tokyo tech graduate becoming a designer and for a while after i graduated i was just working frantically now my thinking based in the sciences sometimes gives a favorable impression and at other times i am told that my comprehension makes it easier to discuss business i make a conscious effort to distinguish when to use my left brain thinking and my right brain thinking watanabe what do you value when you design kodama i want to craft the design starting with user experience i consider myself proficient in ui ux design i don t come up with ideas out of the blue but i keep an inventory of my own experiences and based on them think how i want users to feel i feel that this thinking is important watanabe with new services you haven t experienced them yet yourself right when you design such new experiences where do they come from from daily life virtual or do you think of daily life and the virtual as contiguous kodama many of my dx projects are about designing services to automate or make efficient the tasks that are being done by salespeople when digitizing a book for example there is an experience to base it on touching paper often there is a connection to the real world ui ux design involves more than just whether it s good to look at what is required is how to interpret into reality what the client a company or society considers good because i m designing what is directly connected to how people behave i also have to view it from the vantage point of pursuing a profit margin or other figures i feel from experience that i can make the world better with design that factors in business and not just artistic sense and i keep my views updated watanabe as a researcher i find that when publishing my research findings in the end the power of design greatly influences the communication of the findings to people in the past i was making scanning technology that would perform times faster than current technology for digital archiving converting books into images however some people insisted that a book is an object that is complete only when the paper and the tactile feel are part of it meaning that simply making books into images does not qualify as digital archiving this made me feel that we must consider what the true nature of an object is a high speed high definition book scanner system with high speed machine page flipping real time d deformation recognition technology and a high speed distortion correction algorithm one book of around pages can be digitized in one minute kodama what was your conclusion in response to the comment that it was not digital archiving watanabe i believe that it is not digital archiving unless it makes recreation possible preserving the surface of a book is not preserving its true nature we need to think about whether we would be able to hold it in our hands as an object with the same paper and tactile feel say years from now so i believe that the issue is how we can reproduce the material that we take in this background is one reason i started work on projection mapping which allows me to investigate the true nature of objects from both viewpoints the real and the virtual projection mapping allows the reproduction of real things virtually for example a tattoo cannot be easily erased but projection mapping can change a tattoo s design in an instant it s also possible to make an everyday object look like a diamond so what does that do to the sense of value that we held i am doing research to ask this question and involve many people in considering it kodama i love your stance of trying to involve people in the development of technology there are researchers who love research and want to make new things and i m moved to know that there are also those who want to pose a question to the world and design to communicate it to people what s important in ui ux design is that there is a person we want to communicate something to and we try to reach their heart this thinking has much in common with your work considering design and technology through logical thinking and multiple perspectives kodama i ve been spending more time at home because of covid and it s made me notice more changes around me changes in the chirping of birds changes in the way the wind blows i ve been thinking recently that it s important to design my surroundings so that i can notice such variables in daily life watanabe i can see your scientific thinking in how you described changes in society and the seasons as variables i m impressed you re making it a part of your daily life it must help in organizing your thoughts and laying the circuitry of thought to communicate them to people kodama now i think that even studying factorization was useful experience has many variables and i think that mathematics fostered my thinking on how to break them up into different factors watanabe i loved sci fi when i was young and watched lots of it when i take a practical look at the technology in them it helps me come up with ideas i also recall that an artist i met was thinking about things logically not just with his artistic sense and it made me realize that logic can give rise to unexpected things that move the heart kodama sci fi can be something like a starter for the imagination and i find that it gives me hints too it s amazing that you are looking at both design and art watanabe no no it s nothing laughs although people have the impression that the outcome of our industry is the solutions we provide of our work is various viewpoints and i feel what s important is our ability to discover problems kodama it s like mathematics the equations are difficult to craft and after it s been created all that is left is to prove it watanabe when i collaborated with artists and dancers what i found difficult was to negotiate between technology and art what each side could not compromise kodama people think that what s required in design is artistic sense but what s really important is to first organize your thoughts and communicate what s vital in directing is how much we can express in a common language with less opportunities to talk face to face because of covid i think it means we have to work to get even closer i m guessing that s true of technology as well watanabe there are actually many examples of technology limiting people s behavior without them realizing it take a photocopy machine for example we hold down the cover when we re scanning a thick book and that s because there is no technology to make the book flat the design requires work of people it s an omission on the part of technology i think what is becoming necessary in engineering is the ability to find such problems from a design perspective the advantage of dynamic projection mapping is its speed a d display made more realistic by using the physical materials to be reproduced as the screen and rotating it by using real yarn to show a panda made of yarn for example it improves both the d rendering and the texture reproduction kodama projection mapping is already used in art entertainment and advertising but i heard that your research is about the more advanced technology dynamic projection mapping what is your goal watanabe the concept is that the appearance of what is in front of you can be changed at will i want to introduce digitally processed objects into daily life to do this requires being able to project onto a target in motion capturing with cameras reproducing with modeling projecting with projectors and correcting the software and hardware for all these four steps must be fast the speed here is one of the advantages of the technology further whether the projection on the target in motion looks real depends on the time it takes to project and though we are speeding it up it will never reach the ideal of zero seconds but humans are not aware of latency if it is within a certain length so i am aiming to change appearances at will by including aspects of cognitive psychology kodama what is the latency that human eyes still perceive as real watanabe six milliseconds seconds aiming for this time is one of the tenets in my laboratory and we replace our cameras and other equipment with those of higher specs each year our projectors are among the fastest in the world as we update the core technology of hardware we are also expanding our application little by little kodama the speed that humans perceive is also important in ui ux design with websites for instance the loading speed tends to be felt and i m also looking at cognitive psychology and using it like how showing an animation on the load screen that indicates waiting time makes a difference in the psychological burden i feel that more things are taking such facts into consideration we re raising the average level this is good watanabe when i attend events with research presentations there are people from many fields from cognitive psychology to philosophy to statistics even regarding the ux of one device the breadth of consideration is growing such as ethics and cultural anthropology and i feel that it has become time to carry out research from many vantage points not just in one field the technology to reproduce realistic textures will redefine design kodama worked on a redesign of the member only work styling website of mitsui fudosan she was committed to making it a user first design and created it after much stubbornly frank research and discussion the resulting design is a comfortable experience for the user kodama you are continuing your research at a university as you consider multiple perspectives where do you see yourself going watanabe what s important to me is when someone hears of the research idea would it the following day change that person s view of the world would i be able to deliver an experience that makes the person not want to go back to the way things were before with such ideas in mind i would like to further my current research and produce scanning that would make it possible to possess tens of thousands of books in a flash and projection mapping that can change the value of things visually without constraints additionally i will try to pioneer futuristic technology with a view of the real and the virtual as contiguous concepts in this especially i think opportunities to work together with designers will be important kodama a design engineering point of view is necessary for technology to evolve watanabe i agree one account of a lack in technology is when smartphones first became available iphone designs for icons and other elements adopted skeuomorphism the idea was to supplement with design to get people used to the skills of operating smartphones but eventually this was replaced with flat design and material design as the designs moved on and trends changed it made me wish there was something that design needed from technology in return have you had any moments like that find my tokyo list is a new service of tokyo metro and kodama was the art director and ui designer a user can just select photos to collect destinations to recommend into a list kodama what i personally feel as i use devices is that something that supports the tactile feel of objects has potential senses such as touch still feel trapped inside the screen watanabe i think what is called texture is what separates the real from the virtual when we have something that is not real but has real texture and we have the technology to reproduce it at will what design is will also be redefined kodama just having a three dimensional sensation on the display surface will change things watanabe we are speaking about physically unimpaired people here people that recognize the world with five senses but when we think about whether we can operate a smartphone while it is in your pocket we will need technology that will apply to one of the five senses such as touch when we design such technologies we must be sure to incorporate human experience or they will become things that will not meet our needs the digitization of a pamphlet that had been published by hokuoh kurashino douguten until the end of it was designed to be read pleasantly in the app with a feel as close to the published paper as possible kodama yes what the true nature of something is i agree that pursuing that is important in both design and technology watanabe creating a new technology is not all that difficult but identifying social needs that have not come to the fore can t be done with only researchers and engineers that is especially why i wish for students who will be bearing the future to train their eye for looking at society and to take an interest in a diversity of things i hope that they can experience many things they can t find answers to or understand and that they can enjoy their university life with an open mind kodama a combination of engineer thinking and designer viewpoint is needed in society and i believe that design can play a large role in making society better that s why i wish for students to take an interest in design with scientific thinking to elucidate the mechanisms and principles of the world perhaps viewing design as mathematics it would be wonderful if we could have even one more designer who is a graduate of tokyo tech yoshihiro watanabe associate professor department of information and communications engineering school of engineering tokyo institute of

controlling the interface between bio and nano creating new devices by bridging biology and electronics a peptide that can be synthesized by freely designing an amino acid sequence associate professor yuhei hayamizu studies the nanoelectronics that bridge these small protein biomolecules and two dimensional nanosheets which are showing potential as new electronic materials we followed the possibilities of future devices that can be achieved through his interface research as well as his thoughts on interdisciplinary collaboration understanding peptide self assembly and controlling electronic interactions yuhei hayamizu doctor of science associate professor department of materials science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology laboratory researcher profile in graduated from the department of electrical electronics and computer engineering at the school of science and engineering waseda university in completed the doctoral degree program doctor of science in the department of physics at the school of science the university of tokyo also in became a postdoctoral researcher at the nanocarbon research center national institute of advanced industrial science and technology aist in became a project researcher at the institute for solid state physics the university of tokyo in became a researcher at the department of materials science and engineering the university of washington in appointed as a sakigake presto researcher by the japan science and technology agency at the university of washington assumed his current position in recommended book discourse on the method written by rene descartes this book was recommended to me by a friend when i was in high school and was worried about studying for entrance exams the section in part iii that discusses the need to walk confidently in one direction without wavering when lost in a forest was a real eye opener the book taught me a guiding principle to follow when forced to make difficult choices in life the structure and function of proteins that work in the body of organisms are composed of self assembly that spontaneously forms tissues and patterns proteins with approximately or fewer amino acids are called peptides for many years research has been conducted on the self assembly of peptides hayamizu uses an atomic force microscope to conduct nanoscale observation of the structure of peptides on the surface of inorganic solids in addition he has developed a method using raman spectroscopy that identifies molecules by irradiating a laser and measuring scattered light this has deepened current understanding of self assembly through collaborative research with the university of washington he discovered that peptides can be made to form regular self assembled structures simply by dropping their aqueous solution onto graphene one layer of graphite he observed self assembly into a nanowire structure even on the surface of single layer graphene on a silicon substrate similar results were obtained on the surface of a single layer of molybdenum disulfide by changing a part of the amino acid sequence it was observed that the structure of the nanomaterial was modulated by electrical interaction hayamizu says that the idea of combining peptides which are biomolecules with two dimensional nanomaterials such as graphene was born from his background and experience as an undergraduate he studied at the department of electrical electronics and computer engineering but in graduate school he majored in physics after obtaining his doctorate hayamizu engaged in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes and device development at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology i learned about peptides while gradually changing my field from electricity to physics and chemistry i wanted to use the action of biomolecules as one mechanism of materials hayamizu image of peptides self assembled on the graphene surface taken by an atomic force microscope peptides are aligned regularly along the arrangement of the underlying carbon atoms it was also suggested that the peptide contains an aromatic amino acid called tyrosine and interacts specifically with the electron of graphene established peptides that can maintain a self assembled structure under a biosensing condition by forming regular structures on two dimensional nanomaterials the peptides have high structural stability when voltage is applied and even when under water or in an electrolyte solution hayamizu describes himself as an outsider in interface research a field in which japan leads his starting point in the field can be traced back to his time in graduate school in this research you need the skills of both a producer and director at graduate school at the university of tokyo under the guidance of my supervisor professor hidefumi akiyama i worked on using semiconductor nanostructures to create new lasers the essential point of a sophisticated laser is the extent to which it can reduce the unevenness of nanostructures greater uniformity in structures results in better performance of devices i applied this idea to the bio nano interface the first issue i worked on was how to create a stable peptide structure hayamizu pursued the stability and ordered structure of the bio nano interface themes that had not been emphasized in previous research he also focused on observing what kinds of physical phenomena occur on the structure by doing so it is possible to observe still unknown reactions on the surface of solids such as the relationship between peptides and water or ions in solution and the action when a voltage is applied this is expected to advance understanding on the molecular level beyond precise interface design it is possible to envision biosensors that operate completely differently from conventional mechanisms in our lab we often use the phrase imagine that you are a peptide in order to observe how peptides behave on the stage of a clean interface it is necessary to properly set the characters and the stage on the interface the molecules undergo self assembly and are stable as a whole reconciling with each other the research group takes a bird s eye view of the stage repeating design and experiments while imagining what kind of scene will unfold conducting this research is like fulfilling the roles of both a producer and director of a drama explains hayamizu with a laugh research style learned from his time in graduate school when i was in the second grade of elementary school my father took me stargazing recalls hayamizu he says that the experience was the beginning of his interest in science and engineering as well as his perspective and knowledge for overseeing research projects during his time at the university of washington hayamizu describes that he felt a difference in thinking when working with researchers from other fields at that time i trained myself to apply the concepts of physics in terms of considering matters from a simple perspective that led me to my current work as a researcher however it is said that in the st century new science will be born by interweaving complex knowledge on matters such as biology into physics currently i am conducting research through my own methods of trial and error living organisms are a treasure trove of knowledge and mechanisms the fusion of biology and electronics is appealing because skillful utilization will make it possible to create new devices as a researcher working in this dynamic field hayamizu has the motto while always being suspicious about whether you hold stereotypes create a system for accepting new ideas the relationships between people are important and are the true thrill of interdisciplinary collaboration for example i was given the opportunity to conduct research at the university of washington thanks to mediation by professor sumio iijima honorary fellow of the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology during my time at aist thanks to that relationship we are still collaborating even now furthermore collaborative research with institutions such as the university of manchester rwth aachen university and the max planck institute has expanded because of what hayamizu learned from professor akiyama while at graduate school and through his encounters at aist he is also engaging in collaborations with industry one example is an ultrahigh sensitivity odor biosensor currently being developed through the cross ministerial strategic innovation promotion program sip operated by the cabinet office when considering the increase in inbound tourists during the olympic games companies have proposed the development of social infrastructure to replace quarantine dogs at airports so we started the project and are working hard to meet their expectations getting tenure at tokyo tech and repaying his gratitude to japan hayamizu applied for the tenure track system at tokyo tech when he was at the university of washington and became a faculty member around one year after starting research at the university of washington i was granted research funding as a sakigake presto researcher which gave me the opportunity to return to japan twice a year in order to present results at that time i had already learned about the tenure track system unfortunately the great east japan earthquake occurred when i returned to japan hayamizu returned to america the day after the earthquake i felt as if i was fleeing from japan he recalls in america i lived a normal life although heart wrenching news flowed from japan on a daily basis i felt guilty about being in america and i wanted to do what i could to help japan so i applied for the tenure track system committed to giving back to japan hayamizu is endeavoring to develop unprecedented devices in the coming era infectious diseases like covid will have a huge impact the breadth and depth of research fields such as biosensors and the accompanying sense of responsibility will be immeasurable i feel intense motivation to delve even deeper into the science of solids and liquids and to further advance my efforts in pursuing new research styles for understanding at the molecular level chishu honma nd year master s student department of materials science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology recommended book bushido sixteen written by tetsuya honda continuing to deepen my knowledge and experience i hope to challenge myself through research abroad based on research results by hayamizu sensei showing that peptides act as scaffolds which connect the surface of nanomaterials and biomolecules i am working to develop odor sensors that mimic the mechanism by which humans perceive odors the process of trial and error for example changing measurement conditions to check reproducibility is difficult but when you get results it is very exciting also this project involves collaboration with industry the opportunity to give presentations at progress meetings is a valuable experience for me i chose this lab because i was attracted to how hayamizu sensei truly enjoys his research i hope to continue on to the doctoral program and deepen my research on more fundamental interfaces in the future i hope to challenge myself through research at a company or university abroad mirano tsukiiwa nd year master s student department of materials science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology recommended book guns germs and steel the fates of human societies volumes one and two jared diamond creating products that move people s hearts through the fusion of sensibility and technology adsorption of molecules other than the target molecule also occurs on the surface of a biosensor i am researching the utilization of self assembling peptides to design interfaces which do not mistakenly adsorb other molecules since my background is in chemistry i joined the lab from outside nevertheless i feel that i am understood by hayamizu sensei who enjoys physics research and having chats with students the laboratory has a positive environment which fosters discussions among students my dream is to develop convenient products which bring joy to people i have already received a tentative job offer from a car manufacturer where i will continue my work and research in manufacturing i was fascinated by a car paint that achieves a beautiful blue hue through the use of structural colors i look forward to pursuing technology for creating products that evoke such emotions a phenomenon that creates color depending on the wavelength of light and fine structure some examples are cds and soap bubbles school

an eatery that creates connections sekai kobayashi is the owner of mirai shokudo an eatery with twelve counter seats in jinbocho a neighborhood near tokyo station at her eatery attention is given to each individual customer using unique methods called makanai where a free meal is provided to customers who help with work at the establishment and tadameshi in which customers receive a free meal on behalf of someone who worked for a makanai professor tsuyoshi murata examines the spread of human relationships via network structures by conducting research on themes such as social network analysis and web mining in the coming era communities will be connected on the internet how will networks change with the spread of information in this new age kobayashi and murata discussed related issues from each of their unique perspectives date of interview september at mirai shokudo flexible connections centered around the eatery kobayashi professor murata i was really looking forward to meeting with you today because i graduated from the department of mathematics at tokyo tech what do you think of the eatery murata actually i used to work at a research institute in jinbocho so i am familiar with the neighborhood i was interested to learn that a person with a background in the pure theory of mathematics was opening an eatery in jinbocho personally i don t like worrying about what to order so an eatery serving one lunch that changes daily is great for me do any of your customers complain about this system kobayashi actually since customers don t have to decide what to order the system is popular among people who want to finish their lunch quickly since the menu changes daily every day is different and no fixed items are served although this system does not offer a numerical advantage for example something like our lunches as cheaper than other restaurants by xx yen it is a strength in terms of differentiating mirai shokudo from other restaurants at the same time it is a disadvantage because i can t expect repeat customers who keep coming back for the same signature dish murata your management ideas are quite theoretical and you have established many unique rules and systems for example the tadameshi ticket is a kind of asynchronous communication such as a letter left behind or a message something you won t find on sns your eatery serves as a center that connects people by disseminating information with a time lag and anonymity normally a community spreads like a network however the idea of a structure that connects people with an eatery as the base is interesting it seems that you are intentionally trying to create such a place kobayashi ever since i first opened the mirai shokudo i have been conscious of the relationship between the eatery and customers leading to the creation of the current form mirai shokudo only seats twelve diners this small size creates a single community of customers who like eating here in turn this has the problem of creating a feeling of exclusion for those not in that community murata like a restaurant that requires an introduction from a regular diner kobayashi exactly so instead of a restaurant which is difficult for first time customers to enter i want mirai shokudo to be a place where everyone is welcome and everyone fits in when i imagined a place where anyone could eat and feel like they are contributing i thought it would be risky to position a fan based community at the center of management anyone can use the tadameshi ticket in which a customer who has worked for makanai can give away a free meal in the majority of cases however the person giving away the meal and the person using the tadameshi ticket never even meet this relationship is a feature of mirai shokudo mirai shokudo a small eatery with seats in addition to makanai and tadameshi mirai shokudo attracts enormous attention for its other unique systems one example is atsurae which allows customers to customize their set meal by selecting their favorite small dishes at the base of these unique systems is kobayashi s desire to create an eatery where anyone can enjoy a meal even while kobayashi manages the eatery by herself a tadameshi ticket is left by a person who did makanai which is minutes of help for a free meal the tadameshi tickets are affixed to the wall at the entrance of the eatery any single customer can use a tadameshi ticket for one free meal there are few opportunities for an actual meeting between the person posting the tadameshi ticket and the person using it this asynchronicity is the unique style of mirai shokudo used tadameshi tickets can be viewed in a file kept at the eatery how information spreads through the media murata when drawing a diagram a normal model would position mirai shokudo at the center we would then consider what kinds of groups exist around the eatery when considering how the impact will spread influence may be limited if people with close relationships are gathered kobayashi does that mean that the identity of people delivering information is important murata that s right influence may spread on a wider scale when disseminated from different positions by people with varying attributes when you want to spread information to the greatest possible extent the influence maximization problem is difficult to solve furthermore as the scale grows larger this problem becomes exponentially more unmanageable in a book that you wrote you mentioned the differences in your influence after mirai shokudo was featured by various media outlets kobayashi when mirai shokudo was featured for its business model that was on television afterwards i received more and more requests for interviews from people who had seen that tv program in other words the tv program was the epicenter and then there was a unique ripple effect that resembled subsequent shockwaves also many people came to the eatery after hearing a radio advertisement but no one remembers the name of the radio program when considering that people always remember the name of tv programs and newspapers it s interesting how the human brain works murata i agree the way in which information is disseminated is interesting are there also many people from far away who come here after hearing such information kobayashi well the eatery was featured in newsweek so many foreigners come directly from narita airport personally i believe that restaurants and stores want to control the dissemination of such information what is your opinion of methodologies such as promotional campaigns using sns and the spread of such methods murata there are times when a meticulously calculated plan will succeed but there are also times when such plans will fail human beings are reluctant to participate in artificial movements oftentimes there will be a backlash once consumers learn that they are being manipulated moreover there is no guarantee that a trend can be manufactured simply by involving a large number of people there are many researchers who specialize in analyzing how a small number of groups are responsible for creating numerous rumors when mirai shokudo is featured in one media outlet it spreads to other rival media outlets this is a unique process and i m amazed that it has not been interrupted kobayashi i was also interviewed regarding the covid pandemic it was difficult to film the interview while maintaining appropriate social distancing inside the eatery research on networks fulfills a big role during an age when infectious diseases are having such a huge impact on society murata for example one of the most studied research themes currently is an infection model that shows how many people are infected by covid how many people have been cured the ratio of healthy individuals in each network and how symptoms change over time through certain connections there are an increasing number of researchers throughout the world who are studying the spread of covid for example a certain academic journal posted a paper which applied data to an infection model in order to explain the terrible spread of infections during the initial period in italy efforts are being made to develop drugs by using computer simulations to examine the structure of compounds that are effective against covid and to analyze the repurposing of existing drugs both in models that depict the transmission of the infection itself and when considering drug development networks are increasingly important networks for maintaining social distancing kobayashi how do you think that sns and other forms of connecting over the internet will change will it be an era where face to face meetings are restricted murata first we must consider how to collect the data for example at the current point in time there are possibilities for using apps that detect contact with an infected person nevertheless it is difficult to make predictions based on data because of privacy issues and differences depending on the country kobayashi that s true mirai shokudo functions as a place where people can actually meet this is an issue which i have to consider specifically what changes will occur among future connections in addition to the tadameshi ticket connection i mentioned earlier various people help operate the eatery through a system called makanai currently there is a network of about twelve to thirteen restaurants which have been opened by people who want to run a restaurant similar to mirai shokudo they have online meetings to decide the weekly menu and they send each other information on seasonal ingredients in this way they have established flexible connections murata this shows how open minded you truly are it s interesting how you cultivate future rivals by allowing them to train in your own kitchen and how you have built a network including people from various fields kobayashi instead of creating the same type of restaurant in the form of a chain store i find it interesting when people use what they learned at mirai shokudo to freely change and grow there are certain generations of people who use the makanai system classmates get along well and they often come together to help out via the makanai system this enables them to gain various types of experience we have a network that offers this high degree of freedom murata when you first developed the idea of the makanai system did you foresee the development of a network kobayashi i had already decided to operate the eatery via the makanai system at the time of opening i believed that people seeking to hone their skills would come to the eatery after all this is how i thought during my own culinary training however i didn t consider a future in which circles would become complicated and networks would be formed once restaurants had been opened by people who had used the makanai system those people absorbed various concepts while participating in the makanai system and are now applying those concepts to their own restaurants i have had the unique experience of cultivating skills and knowledge in relationships and environments with open minded people based on this experience i believe that this expansive network is a very good thing murata when someone helps in the kitchen of the mirai shokudo you assign suitable tasks to the makanai helper so that they can effectively improve their skills in a comfortable working environment as a faculty member i often teach students that they need english in order to study and write academic papers however they should first study japanese for using language to properly convey ideas i tell my students to become able to explain the details of their research to anyone in an easy to understand manner kobayashi i agree with you the ability to explain is important for communicating with another person at mirai shokudo i allow people who help via the makanai system to advertise their own restaurants there are many people with excellent culinary skills however even if they make leaflets that introduce their cooking they tend to write specialized comments that are difficult for the general public to comprehend and they fail to gain understanding that s when they realize that there is a gap between what they want to convey and the level desired by their audience murata the importance of communication skills is often overstated these days still such skills are indispensable for making connections with people a place for connecting asynchronously murata i saw that you published a business plan online making it open source is quite novel from where did your idea originate kobayashi my goal is to develop a business plan based on science and engineering logic for restaurants the unit price and other figures are within a realistic range from that point i arrived at the current system as an extension of what i learned from the department of mathematics with the goal of persuading customers to spend an additional yen murata i believe that it is difficult to think systematically in the food service industry however in this way people with mathematical backgrounds are building their own unique community at each restaurant until now the idea of separating matters into the humanities and sciences has been rooted strongly in japan however moving forward i believe that networks which blend the humanities and sciences in various fields will become commonplace furthermore in the post covid era the flow of people is restricted by physical distance and the opportunity to meet face to face becomes valuable it is becoming more expensive for people to meet therefore as we discussed earlier i believe that there will be an increase in asynchronous connections with a slight time difference rather than connecting in real time kobayashi true on the contrary the number of sns followers and page views will be visualized and expanded on the instantaneous internet in that respect isn t there an increase in opportunities for pursuing knowledge exactly in your field of research murata as i mentioned earlier people cannot be drawn in when they feel something artificial and that makes the phenomenon difficult to study as a mathematical model that being said it is an interesting problem to pursue as an academic discipline kobayashi it s typical of professors at tokyo tech to pursue their interests as research rather than an interest in worldly issues laughs murata is that so laughs information networks have diverse structures for example it is important to analyze what hashtags are used and how they transition this is related to a type of research called link prediction which is research on the transition of human relationships kobayashi on sns there is a function that displays people you may know murata that s right the function predicts that a and b will someday be connected the reason why candidates for connection can be recommended is that they have many friends in common are in close physical proximity and have similar attributes each one of these definitions is a research theme it is also a field where sociology and informatics intersect we also analyzed the trends on twitter after the great east japan earthquake by doing so we obtained data showing that when a celebrity with a large number of followers highlights certain information that celebrity would function as a broadcasting station that spreads the information moving forward we will research whether or not this was effective in saving lives even so mirai shokudo is widely recognized even though you don t actively promote it on sns kobayashi actually it s my policy not to disseminate information on the eatery via sns small shops and young entrepreneurs tend to create personal sns accounts however if you sell your own personality you will eventually run out of material i believe that businesses should sell products therefore i basically only promote my books besides my stance is promoting my books as mirai shokudo not myself one feature of mirai shokudo is that i do not stand out rather the eatery is operated through connections with surrounding individuals i believe that this will be one form of networks in the future i think that these vague but comfortable connections are the most attractive point of this eatery murata just as these kinds of flexible relationships spread via mirai shokudo and attract the attention of many people there will be a need for connecting people through physical venues in the future at that time in addition to whom you met where you met that person will also become a valuable element of networks tsuyoshi murata professor school of computing tokyo institute of technology in received a master s degree from the division of science

traveling through the history and future of architecture unraveling the architectural history of the caucasus associate professor yasuhito fujita studies the architecture of churches in the caucasus especially armenia and georgia encountering the hidden histories of architecture and cities and considering their historical meanings and formation he works to help preserve cultural heritages and townscapes what was it about this land so remote from japan that lured him out there what has he seen we took a look at his overseas survey research using detailed surveys to learn the history of a building yasuhito fujita associate professor school of environment and society supervising faculty for dept of architecture and building engineering and urban design and built environment graduate major laboratory researcher profile graduated from the department of architecture and building engineering tokyo tech completed master s course dept of built environment interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering tokyo tech studied abroad at sapienza university of rome italy completed doctoral course dept of built environment interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering tokyo tech appointed instructor ics college of arts appointed assistant professor interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering later promoted to associate professor in current post since a structural model of saint hripsime church that decorates the lab created by professor atsushi muto meijo university the detailed d data obtained through surveys is also used in structural analysis photograph gather record the basics of surveying historical buildings are to record everything possible when fujita arrives at a site he takes photos of the whole building its decoration and even details like the inscriptions he also takes video the rich amount of information in video such as sequence to the church landscape of its surroundings and site atmosphere fujita recording the shape of the building is mainly done using laser measurements this is painstaking work that can measure the depths and widths of each individual wall and pillar so that they can be recreated down to the building s distortions in recent years d scanners with depth sensors are being used to directly obtain a building s digital d data this is helpful if buildings have complex forms or are partially collapsed as they can record the state of the building as it is we ve started using drones in the last few years they let us learn about the top parts of buildings which we couldn t easily see before as well as view damaged areas safely without having to go onto the roof drones have been used to photograph sanahin monastery in armenia a world heritage site as well as its surrounding area previously when collecting photogrammetry data we had to check each masonry joint in a building by eye an almost monastic method but today with drone photos taken from over a hundred points we can use special software to calculate the d data of the building the research is based on the accumulation of this sort of detailed survey data however there are limitations to what devices can be taken into a site and only limited periods in which surveys can be made simply because survey sites are often remote it is a battle between funds manpower and time fujita notes drone photography of sanahin monastery they show the top parts of the building which cannot be seen from the ground as well as the building in its surroundings why is this building shaped as it is influenced by his father who worked in building design fujita entered the department of architecture and building engineering at tokyo tech while learning architecture he realized that rather than designing and constructing his own buildings he wanted to learn about the process of design itself and how building forms develop after a few years at tokyo tech i realized there was a discipline of architecture that wasn t about constructing buildings and i found myself really drawn to it in the master s course he studied under professor shiro sasano sasano invited him to accompany him to armenia for a survey of church architecture initially i had this vague idea of studying islamic architecture but as i was learning about armenia i realized that my interest was in the exchange of architectural culture and so armenia on the fringes of the ancient roman empire and at the crossroads between east and west was much more suited to that than islamic architecture and twenty years after that realization here i am fujita says laughing surveys of historical architecture involve in addition to surveys for purely architectural history purposes surveys designed with an eye towards preservation and restoration of buildings in these latter surveys fujita enlists the help of researchers in seismic engineering and building structure and they carry out structural analyses and strength tests using stone samples in the west research into the history of church architecture is mainly part of art history but in japan architectural history is an engineering category and we look at architecture from a technological perspective as well this is a strength in doing research in the regions and with the help of researchers from tokyo tech and other places i hope to be able to put back some of our research results into the area as a way to contribute spare moments in the midst of surveys are rare but meals are a fun break there are a number of issues in terms of preserving historical buildings in addition to the obvious issue of that country s economic situation hampering preservation there are also the problems of getting locals to understand the historical significance of these buildings and avoiding damaging the value of these buildings when renovating them for increased convenience while the buildings there are part of the cultural heritage of humanity they are more than anything where the local people live their lives we can t push our values on them we need to come up with ways to protect the buildings appropriately while ensuring the locals spaces we need to share them unfortunately at present there s a lack of connections between researchers and restorers in the countries we re surveying getting back to pure architectural history research fujita says the historical value of the buildings in this area hasn t actually been properly established as a researcher of architectural history i want to be able to explain what meaning this group of buildings has within the larger flow of the history of architecture i ll always be considering why is this building shaped as it is wherever i go bringing in a technological perspective to a planar view surveyed plan of telovani church of the holy cross in georgia the cruciform shape is one of the classic layouts of church architecture research on the architectural history of churches has mainly been done by western academics with a focus on the art history perspective their view of churches has generally been planar seeing them as expressions of the crucifix symbol of christianity planar views are certainly one way of showing the characteristics of architecture and there s probably some symbolic meaning inherent in them however it s a one sided way to consider architecture which is three dimensional the perspective of seeing how stone is assembled to create a d building has been lacking in previous research this question was the starting point of our research fujita s doctoral thesis focused on how assemblies of stone could form shapes from the base of a building to the dome on top experiencing actual buildings on site he carefully observed what sorts of stone were used where putting myself inside the buildings touching them and getting a hint of the meaning to their forms is the real pleasure of my surveys he states why travel so far from japan essentially it was just a simple interest in knowing more about the history of the architecture that developed in that region however as an outsider i also have an interest in engaging with the history of architecture in that region by bringing in the idea of considering church architecture forms in terms of technology a perspective that hadn t existed locally we can unveil previously unseen aspects of the history of its architecture and discover and share new values for the buildings and if the new measures for preservation and restoration that arise from this can be given back to the region then there is meaning in our research that goes beyond the barriers of language or location saint hripsime church is an excellent example of the characteristics of armenian churches the stones are interlocked smoothly from bottom to top forming the dome external view of saint hripsime church it is considered one of the eariler examples of church architecture in armenia to guide the history of architecture into the future fujita encourages his students to not worry about wasting time or making mistakes one of the benefits of being a student is that you can afford to fail gloriously i want to see you break out of the limits of your assumptions he says the same applied to me but there are a lot of students out there who don t actually know what aspect of architecture they re interested in and this is why you should be greedy to watch listen and touch all sorts of things if you re going to study architecture a combination of all sorts of things then being omnivorous is just right his research scope has broadened from armenia to eastern turkey georgia and syria but in the future fujita has developed as he puts it an interest in examining the coast of the black sea and iran deepening our understanding of the historical exchanges of architectural culture another prospect he has is finding ways to train people to follow in his footsteps this is because there is an issue with a lack of younger researchers being trained in the countries he is conducting surveys in i wouldn t be able to come close to what ernest fenollosa did as a foreigner for japanese art in the late th century but i would like to continue collaborating in research so that people can see the meaning and value of their cultures and want to continue to learn about them tomohiro kuroyanagi rd year doctoral student graduate major in urban design and built environment dept of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society i want to contribute to creating better towns through both my work and research my research is on urban development in historical streetscapes in fact when i was a first year master s student i took a year s leave to take part in town revitalization in tsuwano shimane prefecture that led me to launch my own sole proprietor business three years ago and i am working on measures to deal with vacant housing as a special official while drawing on my research fujita sensei is someone i can discuss things with without hiding anything he was very accommodating when it came to my leave and starting my business naturally people in the field have a range of opinions and it s hard to develop towns well if you re a researcher who doesn t know the site in the future i want to play a role in creating better relationships as a third party who understands both the research and on site perspectives yuqi jiao nd year doctoral student graduate major in urban design and built environment dept of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society i want to expand my scope from the chinese coastline and follow the path of a modern architecture researcher i came here from china because of my interest in architecture and history my research theme is the urban housing complexes of my home qingdao these were designed by a german and later built by japanese for the chinese so the future of architectural culture connected to three countries intrigued me i was able to persuade fujita sensei to let me do fieldwork there and had great fun determining the design and structure characteristics and analyzing d data fujita sensei s stance is that he doesn t assign you a research theme you find it yourself so it s great that everyone in his lab has their own different theme in the future i want to expand my scope from qingdao to do site surveys in other countries published march
new body theory seeing sports without using your eyes goalball is a sport where you depend not on your eyes but your ears able to handle both offense and defense saki amuro is expected to be a contender for the japan national team associate professor asa ito grew up fascinated by insects and other forms different from her own and through conversations with people with various types of disabilities she investigates physical differences and sports for disabled people this blind athlete and sighted academic got together and discussed their common experiences and new possibilities of the human form training visit december at the tsukuba university special needs education school for the visually impaired gymnasium discussion december in shinjuku tokyo saki amuro practicing shooting while wearing an eyeshade what is goalball one of the official sports of the paralympics it is a ball sport for visually impaired people played with three people to a team everyone wears eyemasks and it is played on a court the size of a volleyball court m by m the aim is to get a ball with a bell inside into the opponent s goal m wide by m high to score a point in the figure above the team at the front is the attacking team one person throws the ball and the three people on the other team try to prevent it from going in the net the defenders must throw the ball back over the center line within ten seconds of getting hold of it or be penalized so there is a rapid switching of attacker and defender one game is played in two minutes halves as the players depend on sound the spectators must remain quiet encountering goalball a sport for people with disabilities ito thank you for making the time to talk with me today watching your training session was the first time i ve actually seen goalball and i was surprised how much active movement and sound there was when did you first encounter goalball amuro i first heard about the sport when i was in middle school but only started playing in my second year at high school it was in a physical education class at high school after i moved to tokyo the teacher who was the goalball club advisor asked if i would be interested in trying it ito you re from okinawa right what was your life like as a child amuro i grew up in a rural area so there weren t any children my own age in the neighborhood and i had to play with my one year older sister we would play in the mud around the flowerbeds in the garden or play with blocks we would sometimes take a soccer ball with a bell inside to the park i lost my sight when i was one year old so i went to a school for the blind in okinawa that school catered to all ages from infants to occupational training so there were people there aged from to ito with all those age ranges at school it sounds like it was its own small town which reminds me when i visited the third year class in the elementary level at the tsukuba university special needs education school for the visually impaired we all played hide and seek i d always thought of that as a game for the seeing so i was rather shocked amuro if it s a room you re used to you get an idea of what is where so you know where you can hide but if you re playing with other people who are blind it doesn t matter if there are walls or other places to hide if you make the slightest movement the slightest sound we can find you so that s why people would often not hide and just stand boldly in a corner of the room laughs ito i see laughs another thing was when the girls were touching a d printed object and said it was cute i was intrigued how much of it could they perceive through touch alone i m researching body theory i m interested in how one sees the world without vision what senses are used so i talk with people who can t see but for visually impaired people circumstances such as whether they are completely blind or just have poor vision whether they were born with it or it happened later changes how they see things how they grasp the world completely amuro indeed i would imagine that those girls considered round shapes to be cute this is something i sensed after starting high school but there are a lot of people with really attuned senses at tsukuba university special needs education school for the visually impaired they can hear the tiny sounds a ball makes when it s rolling and can tell exactly where the ball is or they put a baseball in a plastic bag and use that to generate sound through air resistance when i was in okinawa nobody was coming up with ideas like that and i was like what are these people people with great learning abilities or with good brains can do anything ito that must have been a major culture shock when your environment changes that much you change inside as well right amuro i was no longer able to use the excuse i can t do it because i can t see and i had this chance to try goalball but the team i joined sent athletes to the japan championships each year and that year there weren t enough people to send so i was able to take part in a championship right away in my debut game we lost completely ten to zero we couldn t get hold of the ball at all and that frustration at not being able to stop it has helped me get where i am today seeing your surroundings through sound and touch ito the ball you use in goalball is very hard right like a stone what sort of skills do you need to stop the ball do you see it like making a wall carefully checking posture in defense practice amuro right if you lean over the ball rebounds and ends up in the goal so you need to make your body firm like a wall concentrating on being perpendicular to the ball and floor when the ball comes bouncing you drop to your elbow keep your torso raised and cover with your hand above to keep the ball from getting past you ito it seems like you can try all sorts of attacks bounces grounders add spin use centrifugal force to add speed all depending on the player and the situation amuro the bell rings when the balls rolls so you can tell when there is topspin but with sidespin the bell stays in the center so there s no sound topspin is for speed and sidespin is for changing course or suppressing sound ito in the sense of reading each other it s close to the psychological battle between pitcher and batter in baseball in that it s important to know where each of the players is how much can you tell about your surroundings from sound amuro i have a birds eye grasp of the whole court in play the sense i use is sound but the image i create is through touch for example when i hear the ball i know that the sensation of touching the ball is coming i know the size of the ball from touching it and so i know a ball of the same size is coming towards me ito the ball you see with your eyes gets larger as it gets closer that s the difference right touch is information you gain by touching something with your own hands so it doesn t include position information for people who can see it is hard to understand how the sense of touch can be separated from yourself then come towards you perhaps sound is changed into touch for example what image do you get when you hear the sound of coffee being poured it must be natural for you but i imagine it would be hard to put into words amuro hmm perhaps the combination of sensations of a coffee cup you ve touched sticking your finger in the cup and sensing how the liquid is filling up ito i see so people who can see can also create these combinations of sensations in their heads but for sighted people we visualize things and for you the image would be one of touch amuro when i hear the ball bouncing i can get three dimensional sensations of myself taking the rough hard ball and hitting it on the smooth wood grained floor ito i think i m starting to understand the first time i touched a goalball ball my level of understanding about the strong shock when it bounces increased considerably you re right in that if i d never touched a ball i wouldn t feel any power there i can see how it s not using sound to grasp everything but a combination with touch my view on the sense of touch has changed experiencing sports beyond the self amuro ito sensei what did you feel the first time you touched a goalball ball ito to me it felt like this was a powerful sport where power and power clash why is the ball so hard amuro it has holes so we can hear the bell which means it can t be pumped up with air so it s like a shell goalball didn t start out as a sport but was created as rehabilitation for injured soldiers so the ball was designed not to bounce too much ito the lines on the court have tape applied over threads creating bumps you can always feel them with your hands or feet but can you feel them when wearing shoes amuro we can if you step on them with both feet and stand up straight you ll notice the thinner the soles the better but we re not using shoes for goalball but indoor shoes for futsal if we change our shoes it ll be harder to grasp the sensation at first ito your tuning gets thrown off right tools are clearly very important how do you feel about the convenience of white canes and braille that you use in your daily life amuro it s hard to use a cane in the big city because if it s crowded it can get caught up in the person ahead of me and snap i like braille because i can understand it at my own pace unlike when things are read out which only go at a set pace ito a man called seiichi tejima who helped found tokyo tech is famous for having brought back braille writer machines from overseas to japan back when there was no japanese version of braille he understood the educational meaning of braille and knew how important it was to incorporate in schools for the blind in japan amuro there s all sorts of visually impaired people and all sorts of approaches from researchers as well exactly what sort of research do you do ito sensei ito at the moment i m carrying out joint research with ntt on sports spectatorship the very word spectatorship heavily implies relying on vision but just watching it is only one facet and won t allow you to understand the athletes sensations goalball helped me change my views after touching the ball i m looking for new ways to be a sports spectator using senses other than vision in that sense i think it would be better to avoid phrases like spectator sports one major trial we re doing is the mienai sports guide we ve put out on the internet amuro what is it about ito it s a way to sort of translate the nature and sensations of ten different sports using simple objects from around the home like you can get at a hundred yen store amuro san have you ever tried fencing amuro i ve no idea what that is ito it s a sport where you face off with another person and try to stab them with flexible swords it is a fast moving sport and they use sensors to detect whether the blade has contacted the other person as the movements can be too fast for the human eye to see to let blind people experience what fencing is we talked with a medalist and came up with a translation using wooden pieces shaped like the letters c and h you hook them together like a topological puzzle then one person tries to free their letter while the other person tries to prevent that in this way you can experience the sensations of the sword striking or parrying fencing isn t about just shoving your sword in through brute strength but requires you to use your hands and wrists to match and deflect your opponent s movements amuro san you get an image of it through your experiences of touching a ball in fencing too watching and listening offers a surface understanding but we can use other tools to experience it in terms of touch giving us more information and clarity in other words you have some personal experience with the sport i think this might be close to how you create images from touch fencing from mienai sports guide using wooden alphabet shapes amuro and ito s games ended in three straight wins by amuro ito commented her wrists were flexible and she didn t put any unnecessary pressure on them she might have been the strongest opponent i ve faced amuro like combining sound and touch understanding is deepened by adding the sensations of the athletes right ito exactly in terms of technology there s a lot that tokyo tech can contribute for example something like virtual reality which combines sight and touch what sort of things do you sense when you re in the crowd at a goalball game amuro it feels like i m playing it s like i get the same sensation when a player throws the ball as i do when i throw it ito vision is a first person perspective seen from yourself or a second person perspective seen from the other person for example it s hard to know what you look like from the perspective of someone in front of you but touch doesn t depend on the person whether first second or third senses that can freely change their perspective are interesting you can possess the player through the senses you have when you are playing that s an unknown realm for people who can see i d love to do more research on how senses can go beyond the self technology and sports for people with disabilities ito at the lighthouse facility in san francisco they have a lab where visually impaired people can make things they want using d printers and other electronic work they consider it important to create an environment for people with disabilities to learn how to use technology amuro when someone with a disability uses a tool they hope it can solve their problem so it doesn t have to be something high tech there are plenty of times a low tech solution is fine ito indeed even if we could make a white cane that sends out ultrasound that wouldn t necessarily be the ideal solution the latest technology isn t always going to solve the problem one of my friends made a prosthetic hand for use at buffet parties the sort where you eat standing up that person was born without one arm and had never felt handicapped before the only issue was these buffet parties which assume you can use two hands one to hold the plate one to eat with so this prosthesis only went down to the elbow and had a flat surface at the end where paper plates could be put in other words it was nothing like our arms for that person that prosthesis was the right solution being aware that there is always more than one answer is important both for society and technology and helps bring about new innovations amuro watching sports is the same i would imagine very few non disabled people have played goalball so i d like there to be more chances for them to try it goalball has evolved from medical treatment to welfare and now to a sport but i think it would be interesting if we could combine it with technology and experience it in vr or games i d like everyone to enjoy sports for people with disabilities in the same way as sports for non disabled people playing them watching them or playing games about them ito if they learn about the psychological and intellectual aspects like reading your opponent they ll be able to see how a team is trying to get points and i think they ll be able to empathize if they experience it they ll be able to understand the sensations of the players i think technology still has a lot to contribute when it comes to this sort of new view of sports the surprising connection between tokyo tech and braille seiichi tejima and braille seiichi tejima brought back a braille writing machine and a book from overseas and reformed the preparation of teaching materials using those from overseas as templates convinced that education in japan would open up pathways he argued that even if one has an impairment of the senses the spirit is no different to that of one without an impairment tejima made huge contributions to the progress of technical education in japan as headmaster of tokyo technical

for a greener safer synthetic chemistry into the world of organic synthesis where new discoveries await into the world of organic synthesis where new discoveries await green chemistry is based on the concept of being safe for humans and the environment it refers to chemistry that uses or emits little to no harmful substances how can we efficiently synthesize essential materials like pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals while also protecting the future of the environment associate professor tomoko matsuda is working to use enzymes as catalysts with carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air as reactants while pursuing the development of synthetic reactions to meet the needs of the future her research is leading to never before seen discoveries why use enzymes as catalysts for organic synthesis tomoko matsuda associate professor doctor of science school of life science and technology laboratory researcher profile bachelor of science chemistry department trenton state college now the college of new jersey master s and doctoral programs division of chemistry graduate school of science kyoto university assistant professor faculty of science and technology ryukoku university doctor of science division of chemistry graduate school of science kyoto university associate professor graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology tokyo institute of technology associate professor school of life science and technology tokyo institute of technology morita prize for young scientists tokyo tech challenging research award shiseido female researcher science grant takeda international contribution award enzymes are proteins linked by amino acids that act as catalysts with in vivo chemical reactions a catalyst is a substance that lowers the activation energy needed for a reaction for example if the progress of a reaction is represented on a graph as the x axis and energy as the y axis a high peak will be drawn when there is no catalyst and low peak when a catalyst is present matsuda lists four advantages of using enzymes as catalysts for organic synthesis first since enzymes have evolved in nature over a long period of time they are complex and have high selectivity for specific reactants there are no side reactions in an enzyme reaction so only what is desired is made therefore a chemical reaction that for example required four steps can be reduced to one step it requires less energy making it better for the environment next if the microorganisms that produce the target enzyme can be acquired and cultured many can be produced so there is no risk of depletion the reagent and reaction conditions necessary for the reaction to proceed are safe some chemical reactions use explosive reagents but if it is an oxidation reaction using enzymes safe air itself can be used since there is little risk of side reactions it prevents unexpected dangers lastly enzymes work under the same conditions as inside the human body at so the reaction progresses at normal temperature resulting in good energy efficiency matsuda a good catalyst is highly selective and rarely causes side reactions using catalysts for reactions is one of the necessities in green chemistry using carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air with enzymes as catalysts matsuda is working to develop reactions that effectively use carbon dioxide and oxygen it was found that when carbon dioxide was used in a solvent while in the supercritical state both gas and liquid a lipase enzyme that had not reacted until then suddenly became active it was the first time ever that a reaction could proceed by dissolving carbon dioxide in a solvent and using it as a catalyst for the enzyme reaction matsuda explains while researching solvents using renewable raw materials we wanted to use carbon dioxide as a valuable resource since it is a highly diffusible solvent we can reduce the amount of solvent needed by increasing the pressure of the carbon dioxide and expanding the volume much consideration is given to the environment matsuda s research is based on using carbon dioxide which is safe and abundant rather than organic solvents derived from fossil resources which can be depleted it has been found that even in enzyme reactions where carbon dioxide is used as a reactant the reaction proceeds better at high pressure she is also studying oxidation reactions where oxygen in the air is used as the reactant since oxidation reactions use explosive substances there is always the possibility of an accident even if it is designed safely if oxygen in the air is used as the reactant it will not explode and if you use an enzyme less energy is required for example even if people who live near a chemical factory are told there will never be an explosion people will still feel uncomfortable to eliminate this concern we are developing oxidation reactions that do not use explosive substances matsuda enzymes still have potential at matsuda lab it was found that enzymes produced by a type of mold called geotrichum candidum have very high stereoselectivity for example if the enzyme is likened to a glove the product is made by placing the material inside bonding depending on the orientation of the material right hand or left hand it can only be placed inside one of them but by changing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme through genetic manipulation similar to how a right hand looks like a left hand in a mirror the material bonds in the opposite direction and creates a product with an opposite three dimensional structure and the fact that it was made by a mutation of only one amino acid gave us a major clue for future research matsuda in addition research on the analysis of the three dimensional structure of enzymes is being carried out in collaboration with the high energy accelerator research organization and osaka university simulations where the enzyme binds to the reactant are being conducted based on the three dimensional structure of the enzyme according to matsuda there are clues to the next step such as how to improve it based on comparison with other enzymes x ray crystal structure analysis and simulation joint research with the high energy accelerator research organization and osaka university by examining the structure of the enzyme it is possible to determine how the reaction is made easier according to where the reactant enters why it enters and how far it enters then comparison with other enzymes is carried out thinking that values freedom when in graduate school matsuda says that her mentor kaoru nakamura an associate professor at the time at kyoto university was doing organic synthesis with enzymes which was the start of her research when she was an assistant in the laboratory at ryukoku university professor tadao harada with whom she still often consults began using carbon dioxide for enzymatic reactions instead of supercritical alcohol which was the origin the professors allowed us to pursue whatever we wanted because of this i also want to give students freedom matsuda she cultivated the idea of valuing freedom while in the united states during high school and university matsuda explains education in america helps you develop what you are good at i got into the habit of doing what i wanted to do without worrying about who was watching that s why i still research what i want at university both race and individuality are recognized in that society so in the laboratory i was able to conduct research with other students without discrimination her personality is also reflected in the atmosphere of the laboratory at the school of life science and technology there is an extremely high ratio of students from overseas and in the student rooms there are always opportunities for students to exchange opinions and learn the importance of cooperating with others matsuda herself values the opinions of students and teamwork research cannot be done alone and finding new ways of thinking is stimulating i have learned many things through collaborating with students everyone seems to be unique and enjoy what they are doing even when an experiment fails they quickly recover i want them to engage in many different things and grow as people matsuda enjoying discovery because she hated competition she would try things that no one else was doing she has always valued being herself nature and her hobbies matsuda bashfully added i think each of these attitudes leads to great discoveries enjoying science in the lab discovering new things even if they are small and continuing to engage in research day after day to help solve some environmental problem is something very attractive i want to further develop my research on using carbon dioxide and oxygen and demonstrate its potential i want people to see that enzymes are useful catalysts matsuda looking first at her own research and then at her students she continues what an individual can do may be small however if it is new i am happy and if it helps with an environmental problem it gives a sense of fulfillment i want to continue enjoying discovery each student has a research notebook they do research every day while communicating with matsuda based on detailed theories and findings asked about the strength of matsuda lab matsuda and students immediately answered we have good members shusuke oshima th year bachelor s student department of life science and technology school of life science and technology amazement at doing practical things with invisible enzymes my research theme is carboxylation reactions using carbon dioxide as a reactant and i am working on coenzyme regeneration which plays a role in advancing the main enzyme reaction it s fun when i am able to see that a reaction occurs according to what i expected or can see how my skills have improved i wanted to join matsuda lab because i was interested in organic chemistry and enzyme engineering where practical things are produced by theorizing and assembling things you can t normally see i plan to continue to the master s program and my goal before graduation is to give an interesting and successful conference presentation matsuda sensei is kind and caring and respects our independence i feel that this laboratory is a place where people can work together regardless of seniority afifa ayu koesoema rd year doctoral student department of life science and technology school of life science and technology i want to become a researcher in my beloved field of enzyme engineering and achieve global success i came to the matsuda lab as an exchange student from indonesia when i was a th year undergraduate i really enjoy being able to actually carry out enzyme engineering experiments that i had only read about in textbooks in the lab we study the structure of enzymes and consider whether it can be used for beneficial reactions and develop fixation methods for applying enzymes to industrial use i often participate in conferences where i am able to listen to diverse ideas and presentations and i also enjoy collaborating where i can discuss things with people from different fields matsuda sensei has a flexible way of thinking and it is easy even for overseas students to talk to her she is also interested in our life not just our research so she is like my mother in japan in the future i want to work in academia and continue my research in not only my home country and japan but in other countries as well published september
hello new world a new era of technology and entertainment the rio closing ceremony is still fresh in our minds motoi ishibashi from the creative division rhizomatiks research has participated in numerous collaborative works and performing arts including the production of performances for the tokyo flag handover ceremony with a variety of creators and artists and is involved in all processes of projects from the development of globally successful hardware and software through to operation associate professor shoichi hasegawa has a goal to use virtual reality vr and simulation to create characters that move like humans these two each creators of things no one has seen before sat down for a discussion on the new possibilities of technology and expression held on june at suzukakedai campus the power of live expression ishibashi since i was invited for this i decided to walk through tokyo tech s campus it was the first time in a while it s changed a lot since i was a student i noticed there are many female students in this new generation hasegawa there are definitely a lot more female students compared to before ishibashi san since graduating you ve worked on many installations and exhibitions such as particles and proportion which are permanently exhibited at the ars electronica center but recently we see more performances like dance do you feel that what you have been doing has changed ishibashi technically installations and stage performances are the same the difference is whether the audience can experience it or not we think of dance performances as something you experience and not just something you see since the system itself is created together with the dancers because of this recently i ve come to think that even if it can t be experienced directly it should be watched in the best way possible i think this is why our stage performances have increased hasegawa video is also quite effective maybe this is the effect of youtube but i think it can convey a lot ishibashi we are very conscious of this and that s why we ve tried to create ways where it can to some extent be viewed as a work of art hasegawa i don t think it s possible to plan everything from one to ten you don t just create a sketch and then have people dance according to it right ishibashi there are many ways it can be made for example you can have a dancer move while holding a drone and use motion capture to record it if you fly the drone according to that movement it is like the dancer is making it move and is dancing with the drone hasegawa it s amazing how you have been able to create theater and dance i find techniques that are created on the spot and in real time fascinating this is because animations only recreate movements that have been premade but a vr character for example needs to react to our movements it is difficult to make it respond in real time as facial expressions and lines of sight change when people approach so i m amazed that you have been able to realize this as a kind of improvised stage play also your way of showing it since it is a video i think it is incredible how you use real time and video illumination installation entitled particles a flashing light source floats in the air creating an illusory afterimage grand prix runner up at the ars electronica interactive art category in proportion images are projected onto a moving model operated by a robotic arm and laser pico projector installation for the shonen yo ware ni kaere music video by the yakushimaru etsuko metro orchestra ishibashi in our case our performances are live it depends on the case but with perfume s performance at the nhk kohaku uta gassen we knew there would be about million people watching on tv and not just the or so people at the venue it is a live broadcast for everyone including viewers people know it is a real time process and that it is not pre recorded or edited which makes it more impressive live events have power hasegawa that s true also it is designed to deal with accidents that arise with live performances ishibashi if something happens we try to fix it at that moment but we also have a backup plan because it s real time our creators are also nervous and since certain technologies can only be handled by a certain person missing just one person can really affect the outcome hasegawa in our lab as well often only one person knows how to handle a certain device despite this every time i look the number of measurement controls is amazing i m so impressed that communication is done without any mistakes if the failure rate is it won t work so your number must be even lower right ishibashi i haven t measured it but since everything is linked i m sure the number must pass how do you move the things that move the heart drones performed with drones and dancers machine learning is incorporated to add efficiency and safety to the movement of the drones resulting in beauty to the overall composition hasegawa performances which until now centered on inorganic materials have started to incorporate dancers allowing the works to take on new qualities is there something you are pursuing in regards to movement or expression ishibashi for example even if i move there is little variation in expression and the possibilities cannot be fully utilized only professionals can move in a way that looks enjoyable and pleasing when the director choreography mikiko composes the choreography and gives direction to the dances it becomes clear that if there is movement like this it will be like this picture and the output is enriched hasegawa when creating human movements in the vr world animators do that work they know that if it moves like this viewers will feel like this actors and dancers can express emotions in the same way with movement there is something called biological motion where light points are attached to the body and it is shot in the dark and emotion is conveyed only by the motion of the lights however we have to implement this for virtual characters ishibashi are animators still making such movements by hand hasegawa yes d motion is usually key frame animation where the joint angle and way of opening the hand are adjusted little by little to create movement however a different movement cannot be made suddenly while quality of movement is achieved by animators we also have it react in real time to user movements my laboratory is working on how to achieve both of these ishibashi we also create things like cart movement and light patterns and we use programming to produce movements and timings that look beautiful and there are times when we add finishing touches bit by bit as you would do by hand in animation for example if i have a dancer walk with a motion capture marker on her head and then move a cart according to that trajectory slightly hesitant movements can be produced such noise and fluctuations can be very touching hasegawa if you observe the strange movements of a robot you can see the mechanisms behind its control system you can see the creator s hard work and intention and what is seen and what is judged are conveyed which makes it endearing ishibashi on the other hand if you take full control of the cart and arrange its movements precisely it feels good creators experience such joys hasegawa when there is optimal control you can see that the work is done by someone who has really found the right answers ishibashi in one of our works we flew drones during the test things went awry because data transfer was slow the movement was out of control and became something we could not have created we were supposed to stop it but for a while we were just mesmerized by the movement laughing hasegawa it suddenly began to move like a group of living animals laughs ishibashi how do you make characters move hasegawa there are many ways but it is not like creating cg we use physical simulation for control so it is more similar to a robot with real robots there are limitations such as with torque and range of motion but with vr there is no cost regardless of how many simulations are done and there is infinite power however if the power is infinite it is no longer a human so first of all we developed a simulator that easily allows us to set human like parameters but this is only for the physical body ishibashi so from there you want to implement controls so that it moves like a human hasegawa i am working on a simulation for common human movements such as sensing the outside world determining the purpose of actions and movement if these are implemented as controls it will come to life i am also imitating things i know from psychology such as how fast eyes move so i m trying to create a simulator that moves like a human half based on science and half based on our staff s intuition first finding something of interest and reaching out for it that creates characteristics of living things we are producing a demonstration that includes this mechanism so i think that if the character is able to move it s line of sight according to our movement and it looks back when we wave our hand or if mutual exchange is possible it would be possible to evoke an emotional response from the viewer into an era when humans themselves change ishibashi recently some artists are making promotional videos using vr for example if there were a character that could react to our line of sight it would be totally different so if someone looking at the screen claps their hands one of the characters that is singing reacts hasegawa humans can t ignore it when their line of sight and the timing match so it s interesting in terms of creating a sense of presence the psychological distance also changes depending on whether the eyes move or not if a character is able to look at us we will start to respect their personal space and recognize them as a person not an object when human like characters appear in the future the vr industry will become more active virtual youtubers vtubers have been gaining popularity since last year and i find this very interesting even when there is no performer i think it s possible now to create characters with some intelligence but their movements need to be technically improved ishibashi in the future the real and virtual will be merged at that time we will have to keep improving the presentation technology even in the entertainment world however as technology evolves new presentation and expression methods will continue to be created so i think the hurdles that creators face will get lower today if you have an idea it is much easier to create videos and music than in the past display technology that prevents the mona lisa effect where there is eye contact from any direction by having only the eyes on the front layer and making a duplicate the movement of the eyes can be changed according to the viewpoint to clearly indicate who is being spoken to among many people resulting in a natural conversation development of technology where the vtuber itself automatically reacts natural reactions are captured such as shaking when hit by an object and receiving a thrown item in addition to the movement of the performer hasegawa dissemination and understanding have become much faster when vr becomes more common in the future in other words when media evolves the information received will be closer to the actual experience and it will be communicated more quickly and over a wider area according to the media researcher marshall mcluhan people began to write after having verbal exchanges and began to think about things in terms of sentences according to order later television restored the way of thinking where users directly feel things based on video and audio when mcluhan saw children who had grown up in the television era he realized that they were different from himself i think we must recognize that the generations raised in the internet and vr worlds have been educated and think in a way that is different from ourselves ishibashi there are definitely some amazing things in this generation our company holds workshops for middle and high school students we assigned roles such as sound dance programming and writing based on their desires and motives formed teams and had them give presentations they picked things up quickly and could handle the assignment it is essential to develop such human resources to survive the future hasegawa i think that our way of communicating will continue to change in the future similar to vtubers with vr the body can be replaced different communication is possible using a different body from your own in a different world if such an era comes about it will be interesting to see how humans will change also i think it would be good to create this world using our own will instead of being controlled by a system for example with sns you can configure settings so that you only receive the information you want to see this will be possible in the vr and ar worlds so if there were a mechanism where the optimal settings for each person can be known and controlled and it could be operated properly i think it would have great potential and make people happier using a physics engine computer generated characters controlled by vtubers can realistically interact with their environment when a character is hit with an object it performs a natural teetering motion then gradually re assumes the operator s posture as if regaining its balance using a physics engine computer generated characters controlled by vtubers can realistically interact with each other when objects or bodies collide their actions deviate from the remote commands reacting naturally according to physical dynamics and without penetrating then gradually returning to remote control left current method right new method does not penetrate computer generated characters controlled by oculus your world comes from what you like hasegawa ishibashi san why did you decide to follow your current path ishibashi there was a robocon class in the old department of control systems engineering now school of engineering and it was fun to scrape aluminum to make robots at a time when there were no d printers i ve always liked making things with my hands hasegawa me too i also took that class laughing ishibashi really that feeling motivated me to advance to the international academy of media arts and sciences iamas after graduation it was a vocational school that combined teaching technology and expression and it was mostly practice from there i began creating things that can be shown to people hasegawa there are many people at tokyo tech who really love both technology and monotsukuri creating things since such students and faculty are gathered here new and interesting things are always being created after coming to tokyo tech i experienced the joy of thinking about something i was interested in from start to finish and then creating it with my hands i definitely want younger generations and students to have the same experience instead of just being given an assignment i want them to know the joy of creating something starting from their own motivation through to completion tokyo tech is a place where people can do that ishibashi since the way of communicating has changed you can now take action yourself for example it s possible for high school students to send an email to you right that was impossible in my days so i think now is a great time and if you are interested in something it is best to just try it by the way after i got involved in dance performances with my work i also started learning dance with my colleagues in my private life laughing i think it s good to try different things and discover new worlds and get closer installations venue for a global media art festival in linz austria ars electronica center

landscapes an expanding horizon in civil engineering and design the terraced landscape of takagai no ishizumi ishizumi or dry stone walling is a technique used to create terraced farmland and keep soil from eroding stones found in the area are kept mostly in their natural shape and piled ranzum without a defined pattern construction is done using dry masonry with no mortar or other binding materials since associate professor junko sanada has been visiting the stone wall takagai no ishizumi in yoshinogawa city tokushima prefecture studying stone walling and working to pass on the technique koichiro sakitani who established the planning and design firm eau in and has worked on numerous public spaces has known sanada since they were students we asked these two working at the forefront of landscape and civil engineering to discuss their views on landscape design held on december at hakko suru caf kojichu brought together by stone walling sakitani thank you for inviting me today thinking back i believe we became acquainted while we were students sanada yes i was in then professor yoshio nakamura s laboratory at tokyo tech and you were in then professor osamu shinohara s at utokyo and our professors were connected as pioneers in the industry sakitani i think the first time we met and spoke properly was at dobokukei radio which started in you were already working in stone walling in tokushima prefecture sanada we even went to takagai no ishizumi to record an episode of dobokukei radio sakitani oh that s right we ve talked on a lot of things but going back to basics what made you take up stone walling sanada after i took up my post at tokushima university in i got my driver s license so i decided to go somewhere i could only go by car and when i was looking places up i found a buckwheat sowing experience event in the hillside of yoshinogawa that happened to be an area famous for its stone walls just traveling on the narrow hill paths made me short of breath the field was slightly sloped toward the valley and it took strength just to keep the small tiller level my whole body was sore the next day it s said that the local population is declining because the terraced farmlands are narrow making it difficult to bring in machinery however i was able to feel for myself that there are difficulties beyond imagination even before getting to the work i realized that even if it s to safeguard the landscape it is irresponsible to make plans without knowing how difficult day to day life there is i felt that to consider the situation properly i would have to try it myself it s also because the buckwheat field i was working in belonged to fumio takagai a stonemason sakitani trying it yourself that s just so like you a bit different from everyone else sanada that s how it started i organized an ishizumi camp for students in that included restoring soil on sloped fields harvesting grass and stone walling i gathered students who would be working with landscapes in the future the harvested grass is left to rot and then sown into the field chemical fertilizers would make the soil runnier and that would run off a field on sloped land i thought they should be aware of this bit of wisdom that adding fibrous plants for fertilizer helps with retaining soil stone walling class for first year students sakitani i can definitely relate to that when i work with historical cultural properties or other public works i often encounter stone walling for example in the goto islands in nagasaki i witnessed the scenery of small rocks we painstakingly piled up ourselves i was so drawn to that very primitive stone walling technology sanada yes it s the oldest construction method in civil engineering it s seen in japan and around the world but the fundamental mechanics are the same place the next stone to distribute force over two stones place it so that the load is in the rear place the hearting behind the facing stones figure following these three principles the only difference is in the methods chosen due to the shape of the stones in a specific region i think even the tools are mostly the same across japan figure place hearting behind the facing stones a thickness about the same as that of the facing stones is optimal the facing stones are sloped toward the back and the bottom base stones are half buried or deeper a pamphlet by junko sanada describes in detail correct stone walling structure using hand drawn illustrations sakitani i remember we talked a lot about the current state of stone walling and passing on the technique there was a project you were doing around to make a square in the middle of a shopping street in awa ikeda in miyoshi city tokushima prefecture sanada i was the chair of the landscape council of miyoshi city and i asked you to participate in landscape design we talked about the outlook for stone walling and you gave me advice about a stone walling school that would match people with the stone walling technique the people who want to learn and the people who need their walls repaired we also organized a professional training workshop sakitani i participated in the workshop in the summer of that was the first time i had ever piled stones and doing it was completely different from hearing about it i was able to feel the texture of the stone and the surface more than i had imagined in this age where people can feel like they ve done something gone somewhere ate something where reality is becoming less clear i was able to feel the realness of my body as part of the earth working and handling real materials before that around i took part in repairing revetments along a river in sukumo city kochi prefecture the stonemason there was so fascinating we look at the stone s eye he d say and he would hook a wire on it using heavy machinery while keeping the center of gravity and place it perfectly like magic he could tell the weight of a stone just by looking at it sanada takagai san the stonemason in tokushima is also very skilled it would look like he just placed a stone arbitrarily but it would fit exactly where it should be when i first started stone walling i would place a stone where i thought he said to but he would redo it or tell me this side is the stone s face sakitani yes they would call it face or eye it s difficult to explain academically you have to be used to looking to know what to look for but little by little you learn to tell the difference i think that s important the importance of emotional attachment sanada stonewalling on farmland is not a craftsman s job it is something done for livelihood the objective is to grow crops on the field the retaining wall is built to create that flat land of course the advantages gained must be balanced against the costs to allocate labor to stone walling that s why stones available nearby are used with as little processing as possible the nature of the stone is different depending on the area and so is the way it splits stone walling methods for different shapes of stone developed and ended up becoming a characteristic of the area sakitani that s what makes stone walling interesting in craftsmanship techniques can be developed with no connection to daily life on purpose i suppose for example for a castle however big and however beautifully you can process and use a stone are factors that may come into play this is not relevant to terraced farmland what s important is whether you can grow vegetables actually takagai san does care about the aesthetics of the stone walling but in a different way he builds it there to look nice because it is seen by people that s about the extent of his concern i feel it s different from doing it because of power or for show sanada i think it s just one of the hundreds of tasks required of a farmer laboring over it is certainly not a good thing and in the method is the wisdom for piling stones efficiently it s really interesting what left the strongest impression on you when you tried stone walling sakitani i felt in a way a hint for becoming one with the landscape i noticed that i had seen the scenery and had thought i understood it but i really had not i think experiencing stone walling would help people to really feel a part of the landscape for example even the road in front of this store took human hands to make but we usually aren t conscious of that but if we look with the knowledge that the landscape surrounding us is a composite of many many thought processes we can t fail to appreciate it that is what stone walling teaches the environment that you re living in sanada that sounds connected to your stance on things i feel that you value the process in your design work what is it that you are particular about or that you always value when it comes to civil engineering sakitani it s really simple my wish is that people who make something and the people who use something take interest in that something we live by interactions with society so give attention to that in the process of planning and designing i look for how much i can create opportunities for people to be involved in the area i do this intentionally by having a person involved even a little i feel that results in an emotional attachment to the place or undertaking it stays with them as a memory sanada with the square in miyoshi city too in the end we laid the lawn together with the residents and made a flower bed with the children speaking of involvement one of the classes for first year undergraduates is stone walling on university grounds sakitani wow that s a great class sanada we spent two days on the weekend piling the stones and it rained heavily three days later one of the comments at a later class was i was thinking about whether the stones stayed intact until then infrastructure was a given something that had always existed since they were born they likely hadn t considered that there was someone who built it but once they piled stones themselves they began to feel like its caretakers wondering is it ok i realized how influential it is to be involved for example in the meiji period even a new bridge being built was of great significance being able to cross to the other side regardless of weather made a real change to daily life today when things are mostly established i think people are not as conscious about infrastructure sakitani i agree infrastructure of course but it s true for clothing food and shelter as well i think experiencing them in person even a little would change the way people view them it is so ordinary to be surrounded by safety and security in life that we hear comments like why is there a step here but a barrier free path is filled with wisdom creativity and technique of people and even if you read lots of books and feel like you understand these can still be hard to notice doing something in person means you gain things through real experience and i think what s interesting about stone walling is that you get to share that with others building future relationships between the environment and people sanada the thought process for landscapes including infrastructure is certainly different for rural and urban areas for example green spaces had been planned as to make green a part of daily life green with a warm closeness that could be felt it wasn t theoretical planning like looking at a map from above however volume came to be prioritized since the early s with emphasis put on the quantified area of parks or the number of trees lining a street there was an increase in scenery like a boulevard lined with what were in fact just heavily pruned trunks i think we need to consider what kind of life green is necessary for sakitani i feel that green in urban areas are always controlled they are planted according to regulations designed for humans and heavily pruned if they get in the way such plants are under the rule of humans however when we go to rural areas the weight shifts to the natural environment and regulation is a bit different there seems to be a difference in the superiority relationship making the rules necessary to keep living sanada yes first nature has its processes and then comes how humans are going to live there landscape engineering has developed in japan as a result of building expressways so landscape as something to control has been the focus rural landscapes is a relatively new field that s definitely not going to work unless the difference in the superiority relationship is recognized sakitani trying to handle nature at the level of handling urban areas probably won t work in rural areas where you gain something from nature it s important to value nature while at the same time not exploit it that connects with your research too i think sanada yes farming isn t sustainable when too many chemicals and fertilizers are used crops may grow for a while but microorganisms and insects in the soil decrease the land becomes less fertile or polluted and no one knows how many years that harvest will continue we have to consider the natural regeneration powers that make the soil fertile to take into account that the use of agricultural land on top of the stone walling is happening based on the cycles of nature and to consider both elements together in rural planning is a challenge for this age of regional revitalization approximately half of the municipalities in japan are designated underpopulated areas and agricultural land in hilly and mountainous areas account for as much as of all agricultural land industrialization and optimization of agriculture is progressing in flat lands but for my research i have chosen agriculture in less convenient more diverse environments sakitani it s motivating to be able to make contributions in research that will equally contribute to the future sanada yes it s a field which will only keep changing rural landscapes in particular have gained attention because of the law protecting important cultural landscapes which came into effect in however this is dependent on the old valuation as traditional scenery now that sustainable development goals sdgs are a global standard we need take how rural areas used to be and the techniques inherited and redefine them as new values such as sustainability fit for the way society is becoming i feel that this is not just nostalgia or a study of the old to gain new knowledge there is value that we need for the future sakitani i also feel there is a need to do things differently than before in this age with great changes trial and error with that goal is exciting organizing the requirements and producing an output design incorporating them all drawing out the optimal solution for a land certainly requires human involvement so i am now careful about balance so as to not favor just one opinion sanada for example if population decline continues tax income decreases and there comes a time when we all have to maintain public plazas and structures ourselves the position itself occupied by infrastructure must undergo great change it looks like you re taking on that challenge dejima main gate park in nagasaki city a work by koichiro sakitani photo orient ing kennichi kojima sakitani yes that s true i was involved in a project in nagasaki city nagasaki prefecture for the bridge and a park at dejima after its completion residents of the city began wiping and sweeping it every two weeks that kind of involvement creates an emotional attachment as if the bridge and park belong to them personally it s one of the new ways of being involved with infrastructure sanada the point is how much they think of it as theirs if people are indifferent about infrastructure they won t help keep it clean from your point of view do you see anything like a trend in that sakitani it feels like the landscape and architecture industry in japan is more conscious of bringing about things than crafting things but just following trends is not enough crafting things is still important we have to be conscious of craft as well sanada while we re talking about rural landscapes in italy a growing number of people are wanting to live in harmony with nature in a cycle in particular university graduates moving to the countryside to start agribusinesses have made the news the proportion of university students there is less than in japan and it seems to be having an impact that these graduates of high social standing are taking up agriculture sakitani i believe you studied in italy for a year as a student have you discovered anything thanks to your international connections sanada when i was a study abroad student there i was working with city landscapes there wasn t much being done about the rural landscape in italy at that time and my interest at the time was also city landscapes in italy discussion and research on rural landscapes started in the s and i also started to focus on rural landscapes after leaving for my post at tokushima university it was a total coincidence after that i was able to get to know people doing or researching stone walling when i went to italy for research in for three months there was an international conference for terraced farmland in and we held a stone walling camp in with most of the attendees being tokyo tech students in june of this year we were invited to represent japan in a stone walling competition most of the stone walling and terraced farmland professionals that i have met in italy are highly conscious of the environment of course it s because that s the viewpoint from which they are studying stone walling but my impression is that many of them are conscious of minimizing the load on the environment in their daily diet or otherwise connect their professional lives with their daily lives encounters broaden design sanada with stone walling and other rural landscapes i don t design so intentionally judging whether a design is good or bad is greatly affected by the person s values the rural landscape reflects the way of life and the philosophy of the people who are farming and living in a sustainable way i feel that we have to create a society that values that as beauty of course a stonemason may give the work a nice appearance as a courtesy but i feel we need to become able to appreciate that aesthetic as opposed to having to make something that is aesthetically pleasing sakitani pursuing good design is difficult for example fermentation is the theme of eau s caf kojichu fermentation is something good for people that by the work of things we can t see becomes good food i think good design is like that when society is improved in a similar way though it s commonly misunderstood it s not that if something is produced a good society will follow if it feels pushy people won t feel like they want to go like people places and landscapes also need something unguarded something profound about them i think it s important how those qualities are present in things so that people are incited to want to go to want to do something there just like there are a lot of things wanting for this caf laughs sanada i ve been meaning to ask why did you choose this location hongo to open a caf adjoining your office sakitani i ve been indebted to hongo since my student days so it started with me wanting to give back to this community it s not a field in a rural area but i ve been blessed by this environment and benefited from it for over ten years in the process of giving back to the community i thought that maybe we would encounter opinions and ideas rooted in the reality of this area and community that we re working with right now as we followed that thinking it ended up being in the form of a caf sanada i see landscapes and civil engineering really are intimately related to society so you can t say all it requires is calculation though it s engineering even with an embankment building it strong is not the only factor designing it without knowing the circumstances of the community being protected could upset the landscape and routes of passage studying civil engineering means that you gain the power to make huge changes to space so i think it would be a very difficult field for someone who doesn t take interest in society sakitani that s a thought for students working toward civil engineering i feel that there is no way to avoid working on the problems of society i take interest in the person in front of me the person i speak with for work for example if the population has declined where that person lives and industry has also waned but that person has to keep living there i feel i want to do something about that if i can tweak the mechanism of the world a little and bring a good output it could turn out well for the people there that s what i think about as i work sanada it sounds like everything you do is based on being interested in the person in front of you and paying attention to the community or area sakitani yes that s true at a project we did in sado city niigata prefecture we designed a plaza with keen attention to what the local people were thinking of and a concert was held there after its completion i ve also heard from patrons of this caf that they would like a concert in ways like that i want to keep treasuring how people feel when they visit the place and how they ll connect that feeling to their next actions sanada paying attention to people could be called the first step to entering the world of civil engineering or architecture in university too i recommend diving in if something seems interesting for me i started going to a lab during the summer break of my second year in undergraduate study usually students are assigned in the fourth year but my experience was that i was able to open up different paths because i frequented a lab that i became interested in after attending a lecture you studied at hokkaido university and the university of tokyo did you have any experiences that left an impression on you sakitani though they were both civil engineering departments the cultures were totally different at hu and utokyo in addition i think that a role a university plays is how much of your future potential you can encounter there in that sense when i came from hu to utokyo i felt definitely more points of contact with society at utokyo sanada tokyo tech is also in the capital region and that holds true here too there are many types of people not just in civil engineering or architecture and similar to how we did there may be an opportunity to meet an interesting professor sakitani i hope students look forward to meeting people who will extend their potential believe in the path that interests them and strive in their chosen path takagai no ishizumi the name of the area is ogami but the site is called takagai no ishizumi or takagai region dobokukei radio meaning department of civil engineering radio an internet radio station broadcasting varied topics related to civil engineering landscapes urban development and design and the like sakitani and sanada are core members involved in its planning and administration hearting small stones placed behind facing stones its roles are to anchor the facing stones and to function as a drainage layer heavily pruned being pruned by cutting thick branches short or cutting off several branches and buds it is done to keep trees compact but the stress on trees is great and there is risk of branches dying important cultural landscapes cultural landscapes located in a landscape planning area or landscape district of japan they are cultural properties that have been selected by the national government as especially important among those protected by prefectural or municipal governments junko sanada associate professor school of environment and society tokyo

the future of computers is in sight quantum computing now and hereafter pursuing foundational technology leading to quantum computers a quantum computer is scheduled to make its first appearance in japan before the end of fiscal year the d wave quantum computer will be installed in the research center formed by tokyo tech and tohoku university to date tokyo tech researchers have been accessing a machine installed outside japan via the cloud but now progress is being made to join tokyo tech s basic research with tohoku university s applied research and also cooperate with industry to develop a global research hub in the field of quantum computers filled with brilliant global scale advances in r d associate professor tetsuo kodera is working to develop foundational technologies using semiconductor silicon we asked kodera and two of his students to tell us about the current state of quantum computing and the outlook for its evolution what is a quantum computer tetsuo kodera associate professor school of engineering faculty of the department of electrical and electronic engineering quantum computing unit laboratory researcher profile graduated from the department of physics faculty of science the university of tokyo in received a master s degree from the department of physics graduate school of science the university of tokyo in received a doctoral degree from the department of physics graduate school of science the university of tokyo in became adjunct assistant professor at the institute for nano quantum information electronics at the university of tokyo in assistant professor at the quantum nanoelectronics research center at tokyo institute of technology in and associate professor at the department of physical electronics graduate school of science and engineering in at current post since doctor of science calculations that would take thousands of years on current supercomputers solved in under a minute that is what is expected of the quantum computer a completely new computer using the principles of quantum mechanics a theory in physics which describes behavior at nanometers one millionths of mm or even more minute scales why would calculations become that much more rapid conventional computing machines constructed based on the laws of motion of classical physics use a unit called a bit representing information in binary or this is called classical information and using a metaphor of a stone that is white on one side and black on the other only two states can exist white or black each piece of this information is processed sequentially meaning that if there is a large amount of information calculation will take a large amount of time on the other hand quantum mechanics can handle superposed states unclear whether they are white or black being partly in both states at the same time called quantum information it uses a unit called the quantum bit qubit containing both and at the same time thus an infinite number of states can exist and an overwhelming calculation speed is realized by processing all the information at the same time even for large amounts of information figure the evolution of the conventional computer is nearing its limit and i feel that expectations for the quantum computer have heightened in the last two or three years certain types of quantum computers like ibm q and d wave have begun to be put to applied use and we are now at the phase to consider applications and other factors kodera superconductors are a step ahead as the material of quantum computers an area of fierce r d organizations like google and nasa are working on their materials approaches include photon cold atom and ion trap but what kodera is focusing on is semiconductor silicon a material that is receiving as much attention as that for superconductors why make quantum bits out of semiconductor silicon a quantum dot is a semiconductor that is tens of nanometers in size and can be thought of as a box in which an electron can be confined and manipulated it is also called an artificial atom kodera focused on silicon as the material early on and has been developing quantum dot devices his silicon quantum dot device applies the structure of a metal oxide semiconductor mos figure kodera states it is compatible with existing silicon technology and it is well suited to integration because it resembles a basic mos transistor there are three major types of silicon quantum dots early on there was much development in the dopant type then attention moved to heterojunction type silicon and silicon germanium si and sige and expectation has risen for this mos type in recent years to produce quantum dots first thermal oxidation is used to control the thickness of the silicon on insulator soi layer next the components that will become the quantum dot and the gate structure are formed using reactive ion etching then the gate oxide is formed using thermal oxidation and lpcvd following that a polysilicon top gate is created using lpcvd photolithography and plasma etching then finally the source and drain are formed a paper on silicon quantum dots in two dimensional arrays produced using this method was published in applied physics letters in february figure figure a silicon quantum dot device using the mos structure figure silicon triple quantum dots in two dimensional arrays accepted by applied physics letters to appear in the spin of electrons and holes can be controlled with a quantum dot and the spin up or down is used to represent whether the information is or development of the qubit is to create that the superposed state the electron spin and hole spin that represent information are disturbed by mutual interaction with the nuclear spin of the material itself so preserving their states is difficult study on semiconductor spin qubits began about years ago mainly with gallium arsenide gaas however it has become clear that gaas types affect spin qubits because of their nuclei have nuclear spin because of this silicon has attracted attention in recent years and many researchers are migrating i was using gaas types as well when i was a student but that problem was apparent so i worked with silicon as soon as i graduated this is because of silicon does not have nuclear spin i felt i went a step ahead with the idea of not having information disturbed by nuclear spin kodera increasing the time quantum information can be preserved coherence time is one of the major themes there are many factors that disturb spin and need to be reduced including magnetic noise electric noise and thermal noise there are diverse approaches being worked on in each aspect materials device production measurement to reduce noise and to preserve quantum coherence among such approaches silicon has less magnetic noise due to the properties of the material itself in addition technologies to form high quality oxide film and microfabrication of silicon exist and have matured making it possible to minimize electrical noise in the device compared to other materials further since microfabrication is possible being able to integrate qubits on a large scale into a size that would fit in a refrigerator is a distinct advantage for future application a cryogen free refrigerator which takes measurements in an environment of reduced thermal noise by setting quantum dots in ultra low temperatures temperatures extremely close to absolute zero tetsuo kodera masahiro tadokoro and seiya mizoguchi prepare for an experiment to evaluate a quantum bit at ultra low temperature this large refrigerator meters underground is used for experiments requiring a large magnetic field partnerships centered on this tokyo tech laboratory one laboratory s research theme is not expansive enough to develop a quantum computer collaborative research with another group with its own forte is the stance at kodera lab which has led to valuable relationships with groups inside and outside japan some of its variety of partners have been the university of tokyo riken and the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology in japan hitachi cambridge laboratory in the united kingdom and the delft university of technology in the netherlands for example the university of new south wales in australia has been making huge investments in silicon quantum computers since long ago and they have produced some wonderful outcomes in recent years opportunities for discussion and exchange of opinions with such outstanding researchers can give birth to new ideas research by one person is not going to be enough so i want to be attentive in building human relationships and continue as i have been doing straight and true kodera it is not only materials and devices understanding of and cooperation with a wide range of fields including circuits system and software are also key in carrying out research the department of electrical and electronic engineering at tokyo tech has an array of professors who are experts in those fields and it s easy to consult them i don t know of any other university with so many research fields in one department also large companies have begun to participate in recent years and the quantum computer is in the process of moving from the physics phase of basic science to the engineering phase with industrialization in view engineering to industrialization is tokyo tech s forte many professors here are experts at that and i feel that makes for an excellent research environment kodera the fact that professor hidetoshi nishimori is at tokyo tech is an added boon to research here professor nishimori proposed the use of quantum annealing in quantum computing kodera was in an environment which enabled him to participate in the quantum annealing project led by nishimori and use a quantum annealing machine called d wave firsthand he was able to share information and discuss issues directly through this it occurred to him that perhaps the qubit that he had developed suitable for the quantum gate method could also be used for the quantum annealing method also concerning the material for the qubit he started to include superconductors in his research instead of working only with semiconductors in describing his outlook kodera states until last academic year we were studying artificial photosynthesis power devices and other research related to energy now we are concentrating on the quantum computer only and all members of the laboratory are working on this r d by others is moving fast as well so i want to focus on this one area and speed things up a destined encounter shaping the future kodera s research had its beginnings in his time as an undergraduate at utokyo where he heard the words quantum computer in an applied quantum mechanics class it was surprising to me that this perplexing quantum mechanics would be useful in reality and that it could make a computer surpassing the computers we had then at the same time i was intrigued he reminisces he went to ntt basic research laboratories for a tour where he was introduced to professor seigo tarucha and went on to the master s program to join a laboratory he formed a quantum bit group with an international postdoc and began pursuing his research after receiving his doctorate he became a research associate at the institute for nano quantum information electronics at the university of tokyo in the laboratory of professor yasuhiko arakawa in april then in may he was sent as a delegate to the united kingdom that destination was the hitachi cambridge laboratory that is where i encountered silicon and thought of developing a quantum bit using silicon and spin had i not studied under professor tarucha and been sent by professor arakawa it may not have become my theme it was truly a destined encounter kodera as if further led by the red string of fate he met two tokyo tech students belonging to shunri oda s laboratory who had also visited the hitachi cambridge laboratory that is how he came to know of oda laboratory his next affiliation as an assistant professor according to kodera he was able to continue researching in cooperation with utokyo and hitachi cambridge thanks to being invited by professor oda who was studying silicon quantum devices it was really all a coincidence he says shyly and until the previous academic year i had the privilege of being a part of professor mutsuko hatano s lab professor hatano radically advanced research in industry before coming to tokyo tech as a professor she taught me how to progress in research from an engineering viewpoint that view turned out to be indispensable to my work in quantum computers kodera ten students are currently in kodera lab openness between faculty and students is fostered through meetings for all members and weekly one on one meetings where students can ask about anything they also socialize through badminton which kodera has been playing for over years social gatherings and trips taken as a lab this is all to create a laboratory with good communication in collaborative research with external organizations or in development at a manufacturer a common path after graduation i think relationships and trust are important in everything i make it a point to warn students and point it out to them only when they are lacking in those respects kodera kodera lives by that philosophy himself and has been supported by many encounters since he was a student in research i want students to enjoy the process itself as they take on new challenges and to facilitate that it is also important to study the basic academics and liberal arts he states when i gave a lecture at my old high school the students there asked so many questions that we went well over time a master s student who came with me said he was impressed by how they showed such interest quantum computers are evolving day by day i want to further my research first realizing a highly precise silicon qubit at the same time i also want to find a design that suits integration and which has not yet been seen in the silicon field our major focus as a lab is the device but by cooperating with those in connections circuits and systems discussing often and raising our lab to a much higher stratum i want to incorporate everything having to do with the quantum computer into our research kodera as he spoke kodera s eyes reflected his strong determination to create a quantum computer the future of computing is certainly in his sights masahiro tadokoro th year electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering i want to create with my own hands something new that will change the times i entered the department of electrical and electronic engineering after being shocked by the usefulness of smartphones which i started using during high school i wanted to join kodera lab because i wanted to research something new quantum computers there are many things i don t understand because it s not a field covered in undergraduate classes but senior members and kodera sensei explain things thoroughly kodera sensei values the experimental process i have a lot of opportunities to communicate in english and i feel i can broaden my opportunities our current research is to evaluate current characteristics of a device with three quantum dots arranged in a triangle i hope to continue my research in the master s degree program seiya mizoguchi nd year master s student department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering a lab where you can interact with the technology shouldering the next age i am researching spin manipulation of charge in quantum dots for realizing spin qubits it hasn t been realized yet due to issues such as temperature rise due to applying high frequency signals and construction of a measurement system to detect minute signals the interesting part of this research is collecting knowledge by myself and discussing with others to achieve results i was very interested in the new discipline of quantum mechanics and wanted to enter kodera lab by the words quantum computer i already knew kodera sensei through badminton he values communication very much i will leave the university next year to start working but i wish to keep using the knowledge and skills i have gained at this lab quantum bit qubit a quantum bit qubit is a bit used in quantum computers it has been implemented in many physical systems including electron spin and hole spin in a quantum dot quantum dot a quantum dot is a structure of microfabricated semiconductor which can confine individual electrons or holes a hole made by a missing electron reactive ion etching one microfabrication technology to

from fins to limbs unravelling the mystery of evolutionary morphology in october associate professor mikiko tanaka and colleagues published the study in nature ecology evolution that attracted attention from researchers all over the world this paper overturned conventional theories in tanaka s field of evolutionary developmental biology or evo devo for short a major topic of research is to understand how various organisms have evolved by changing forms and the transition of their development programs animal limbs evolved from fish fins mikiko tanaka associate professor school of life science and technology graduated from the department of biology faculty of science osaka city university completed ph d at the department of biology graduate school of science and faculty of science tohoku university worked as overseas special research fellow at the japan society for the promotion of science london university university of dundee uehara postdoctoral fellow oregon university joined the department of biological science graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology tokyo institute of technology as an associate professor current position since member of the japanese society of developmental biologists the zoological society of japan the molecular biology society of japan the society of evolutionary studies japan and has served as an officer councilor and in other roles holds a doctor of science degree laboratory researcher profile recommended books i think students of high school age rather than just studying should read lots of books on any animals that they find interesting read what interests you not books that i would recommend all vertebrates living on land including humans evolved from creatures that came from the ocean in the late devonian period about million years ago the first vertebrates to adapt to land were amphibians and it is believed that their ancestors were primitive now extinct fish with fin like limbs and belonging to the class sarcopterygii the class sarcopterygii contains coelacanths lungfish and all tetrapods cartilaginous fish such as sharks and chimaera which are used as models in tanaka s lab show characteristics from their ancestors in my lab we have been studying the developmental mechanisms responsible for the evolution of fins and limbs forelimbs and hindlimbs of animals evolved from pectoral and pelvic fins of ancestral fish cartilaginous fish such as sharks and chimaera occupy critical phylogenetic positions and are good models for examining the evolutionary processes of vertebrate limbs tanaka in amniote embryos skeletal muscles are derived from epithelial cell layers called the dermomyotome at trunk levels dermomyotomes extends ventrally to form body wall muscles whereas at limb levels ventral dermomyotome generate a cell population called migratory muscle precursors that migrate distally into the limb bud their study revealed how the muscles for pectoral fins and pelvic fins of cartilaginous fish are formed it was believed that the muscles of the paired fins collective term for pectoral and pelvic fins of cartilaginous fish were derived from the epithelial dermomyotome directly extending into the fin bud and not migratory muscle precursors this theory was proposed by an english zoologist in the s and in the s a paper supporting this theory was published in nature making it an established theory however some researchers myself included had doubts about this theory tanaka d image of the molecular distribution expressed in the migratory muscle precursors of sharks tanaka and colleagues then used embryos of the catshark a cartilaginous fish to verify the mechanism of paired fin muscle formation it was found that the paired fins of the catshark are formed from cells with characteristics of migratory muscle precursors this discovery overturned the existing understanding of biology and elicited many inquiries from abroad although the cells were re aggregated as soon as they left the dermomyotome from the molecular evidences sections created by okamoto san and subsequent d images we confirmed that the cells were muscle precursors separated from the dermomyotome this discovery showed that both bony and cartilaginous fish develop their appendicular muscles via a shared mechanism tanaka illustration of muscle formation in the paired fins of a catshark embryo cloudy catshark and elephant shark used in the study for the blue elephant shark right the cartilage is stained approaching various questions in evolution through research using catshark embryos tanaka s team revealed that the balance of the anterior thumb side and posterior fields in fin buds shifted as evolution progressed from fins to limbs they further found that the genomic sequence controlling the expression of the causative gene changed they have also studied the origins of paired fins using cephalochordates which are a more primitive chordate with no paired fins there are various types of living things on the earth how did such diversity evolve through the history of evolution why did fins evolve into limbs what was the program for generating arms and legs at the correct positions why are there many different limb shapes among animals i want to approach each of these questions in evolution tanaka tanaka first learned of development and evolution research when she was a high school student in a high school class i saw a video about how a human fetus developed from a fertilized egg into a baby and felt that this was what i wanted to study i didn t think about becoming a medical doctor i wanted to become a researcher who operates on her own but in high school i wasn t good at biology because it was just about memorizing actually i m still not good at memorizing laughs tanaka as an undergraduate she engaged in research on the evolution of sea squirts and in graduate school she studied the morphogenesis of limbs using chickens the foundation of the present tanaka lab was laid through later research in the uk and the united states that incorporated both evolution and morphogenesis i ve always felt that i should do what i care about because you only live once so i m enjoying what i do now however research is not something i can do alone i am supported by tokyo tech and by the hard work of great students and collaboration with outside researchers including overseas is essential for research our study on the development of paired fin muscles using the catshark was done with teams from the university of tokyo riken and the life science research institute crg centre for genomic regulation in barcelona spain tanaka since there are many approaches to research joint research can extend beyond the limits of what any individual can do which is thrilling mikiko tanaka speaking passionately about the origin of paired fins seeking to understand the basic rules for evolution and life in tanaka laboratory not only sharks but other organisms as well such as medaka zebrafish frogs chickens emus chimaeras and primitive jawless fish like lampreys are used for research in their adult egg and embryonic states and students work on their own individual research themes life phenomena are never as they are written in textbooks research sometimes has unexpected results but this is more interesting unexpected results may help you see new facts our findings this time showed that something once considered to be theory can be disproven as scientists and not just in life science the important thing is to observe things with your own eyes tanaka emu eggs used for experiments in an incubator tanaka explains rather that researching something because it s useful i want to research themes that i find interesting themes that i wonder about for example i am interested in whether forms change according to the surrounding environment even with the same species there are birds that have different color feathers in summer and winter ants have different forms according to roles like queen ant soldier ant and worker ant influenced by the environment what development programs control morphological changes like those seen in these examples my research interests are not immediately helpful to the world but i think that knowing the fundamental rules of evolution and life is important in order for science to progress tanaka tanaka s team is utilizing the latest genome analysis technologies to pursue the mysteries of evolution their research using cartilaginous fish as models is technically challenging and unique in japan and it has attracted international attention due to its recent discovery tanaka and her students continue to work according to the philosophy don t worry about what you re good at or not good at do what you enjoy the important thing is to have fun doing research eri okamoto rd year doctoral student department of biological sciences graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology recommended books endless forms most beautiful the new science of evo devo sean b carroll research achievements evoke reactions and that is when the effort is rewarded at the tokyo university of marine science and technology i was studying a fish called the argentinian silverside from south america which is famous as a fish that changes sex during that process i came to learn that evo devo evolutionary developmental biology and i was looking for a laboratory doing research in this field in graduate school and found tanaka lab at tokyo tech fish fins evolving into hands and feet i was attracted to this topic because it addresses such a dramatic morphological change in evolution and so i ve continued in this research with tanaka sensei for the last years the results of this research evoked a big reaction and that made me feel that my efforts were rewarded tanaka sensei is a strong and cheerful female researcher with a great ability to communicate she has been my role model i will be leaving this laboratory for employment at the end of this school year after starting my career i also want to volunteer as a guide on living things and evolution at museums and aquariums in order to use what i ve learned at this laboratory to contribute to society keiichi kai th year undergraduate student department of bioscience school of bioscience and biotechnology recommended books evolution j de panafieu the joys of understanding the mysteries of life when i was a first year i listened to a lecture by tanaka sensei and i fell in love with the field of evolution research i studied with the goal of joining tanaka lab and i was eventually able to join in my fourth year currently i m carrying on research started by senior students related to the morphological change from fish fins to limbs although i find the research itself very rewarding i am struggling with things like dna manipulation in experiments right now experiments often fail and i don t even know the reasons why but my dream is to be the first to discover something unknown about life so i am determined to continue and not give up what is great about tanaka sensei is that she is continuously coming up with new research ideas we students are inspired by her spirit of ambition and want to broaden our understanding of life and evolution about which many things remain unknown

robots humans ai koichi suzumori professor school of engineering ko ishiyama president and representative director exawizards inc coming from the humanities to study science at tokyo tech ko ishiyama found his calling in creating a new society around artificial intelligence advancing a wide range of fields within robotics koichi suzumori is bringing artificial muscles and other new robots and systems to reality with robots and ai continuing to evolve how will they engage with each other in the future will they pave the way for a bright future for humanity we asked these two experts to share their thoughts held on june at ookayama campus in moving to the sciences the path to tomorrow s society became clear ishiyama thank you for inviting me here today i haven t been to the campus since i was a grad student i m feeling very nostalgic suzumori it must have been tough to start a graduate degree in the sciences at tokyo tech after doing humanities as an undergrad you must have had a lot to do ishiyama i was in my second year as an undergraduate when happened that got me interested in the united states and i wanted to visit but had no money then one day i happened to come across a programming contest by carnegie mellon university and i knew if i could get accepted i could go to the states so i spent every spare moment learning java once over there i met professor hiroshi deguchi from tokyo tech deguchi sensei had two doctorates in science and economics and he invited me to join his lab which is how i ended up transferring to science however i needed mathematics to get into tokyo tech so i basically apprenticed myself to a general studies teacher at my university and went to visit him every evening after classes finished it was really hard catching up in calculus and linear algebra suzumori deguchi sensei s lab must have been ideally situated for you to move ahead with your own research what was your topic while you were at tokyo tech ishiyama mainly on multi agent simulations my background was originally in the social sciences and i was wondering if i couldn t improve social science through computer science the term big data didn t exist back then and i could only analyze data from agent based simulations ai involved a lot of research that was shut off from the outside world suzumori this was just when the internet was coming into its own nowadays we can use big data so in a sense we can look at society as a whole as a simulator right ishiyama you re quite right in reality when we create a product and try and find ways to sell it society s situation and responses change and we can use the plan do check act cycle as we look at the resultant data we can expand our research more broadly than when i was a student and by extension have greater impact on society suzumori i m impressed by how even as a student you already had a vision that led you to where you are now ishiyama you re too kind i was researching complex systems in the department of computational intelligence and systems science trying to link micro and macro economic phenomena as a model nowadays we can collect data on both phenomena and analyze them together suzumori so what sort of fields do you see your current work being applied in ishiyama using ai in long term elderly care for example we can now measure quantitatively how symptoms change among those with dementia when they are looked at talked to touched or give other care medicine is backed by scientific data but long term care lacks such support without data we had no means to analyze video or images but now that we can use methods like deep learning we ve been able to use ai to bring a scientific perspective to care giving we can now see how social insurance costs and utility functions vary in accordance with changes in symptoms and nursing care level when i was a student this was just a theory i wanted to pursue but now i think it can actually be done suzumori in science electrical engineering electronic engineering and mechatronics are fields closely related to computer science from there we expand out to medicine and the social science of economics with humanities being the furthest removed where do you feel that you are positioned in the sciences or the arts or perhaps the correct answer is that you don t actually discriminate between them ishiyama yes indeed i started off linking computer science and economics and now my days are busy with trying to link my knowledge with medicine and nursing care i feel that if you want to have social impact it is increasingly necessary to study for a double or triple degree without regard for whether it is in the sciences or arts also in training people in the field of ai i would like it if universities could provide chances for students to study in steps starting with fields closely connected with ai such as computer science machine learning and robotics the concept of e kagen brings a new richness suzumori actual society still lacks a system that connects the sciences and the arts i think we need more interdisciplinary fusion among different fields for example even if we just look at intelligent robots we have today s industrial world where the fields of intelligence information science and robots mechanics are clearly separated even though normally they should be integrated more the reality is that the engineers in each field work completely separately ishiyama on the ai side there is a strong demand for fusion with robotics however i think we need another axis based on the purpose of this fusion for example adding long term care to robots ai gives us a clear and specific goal and i think designing with this sort of directionality is important suzumori my research is also from a mechanics robotics perspective sorting robots in factories these days for example manage highly precise movements and sophistication in conjunction with ai and deep learning we can t easily integrate today s robots into our daily lives without problems that said robots are precise accurate assemblies of software and mechanisms so are very good at moving fast and precisely but they completely fall apart if called on to do anything outside their programming in addition progress in mechanical development is slower than in ai ishiyama yes there s a bit of a gap between the current state and the image of rapidly evolving robots that we see in the media suzumori indeed i also feel that the direction itself rather than the speed of evolution is changing since history began technology has aimed for the power speed precision and accuracy needed for survival against enemies this only accelerated in the industrial revolution and watt s steam engine for example in materials science the bulk of the research was on stable strong materials but there s been a recent change to what you might call unstable materials such as plastics that decay and return to the soil after a time in other words our values have changed from what they were ishiyama society has matured and people are living longer so that s why we are now looking inside rather than outside in long term care too science has started to look at how we can communicate to increase utility functions and indicators themselves we might say our intentions are to find human richness or well being suzumori with how these times are changing one of the goals robotics is aiming for is organisms this doesn t mean simply imitating the appearance of organisms it s about learning the true essence lately i ve been talking about what i call e kagen robots making presentations at international symposiums and publishing in academic journals the word e kagen iikagen in romanized japanese is an interesting term which can imply either good enough or irresponsible ishiyama the same with tekitou which can mean either adequate or arbitrary what are your views suzumori it s because up until now irresponsibility has never been permitted in science and technology it s because we ve sought precision and accuracy that we ve been able to create such wonderfully accurate precise robots but when our target is humans living creatures we don t need to worry about movements on the one micron scale while robots might be good at that they re extremely bad at gentle touch stroking but that s why we can get away with good enough and not build them to be so amazingly accurate in one sense the way the responses can differ through various ai learning states is a sort of irresponsibility and as they learn they become good enough when writing papers on this idea i asked people from different countries what the english translation should be but no one has been able to provide an appropriate phrase so i want to popularize this uniquely japanese concept which has both positive and negative connotations ishiyama that s so interesting certainly a computer science approach is e kagen if seen from the backpropagation method used in machine learning slow gradual evolution allows it to be recorded as technology in today s era of big data i think even minor evolutions in algorithms will have major social impact a fusion of muscles that move like human flesh and intelligence that learns from humans suzumori changing values have social effects and the possibilities of robotics also greatly expand in this sense we are seeing a global boom in soft robotics ishiyama just now you talked about living organisms being one of the final goals what technologies in particular are you working on now suzumori a human leg for example has six degrees of freedom three in the hip one in the knee and two in the ankle degrees of freedom refers to the number of different directions a joint can freely move to move in these six degrees of freedom humans use some fifty different muscles if we directly apply this to robots we would need to use fifty motors to move only six things naturally without constraint conditions it would be hard to precisely coordinate all fifty motors to achieve smooth movement i am working on actuators which combine the functions of muscles and motors and that is where softness and e kagen which were taboo for industrial robots become necessary photo a skeletal robot that moves flexibly using artificial muscles professor suzumori explains in a normal robot for example we would put a shaft in the knee joint which fixes its center of rotation in place but in a human the axis shifts and we can use these artificial muscles to recreate this shift giving us e kagen movement also the artificial muscles are bunched together so if we have an air leak we don t replace that muscle we tie it off and leave it this is just like how human muscles atrophy laughs photo tomoki abe nd year master s student mechanical engineering school of engineering who appears on the cover is wearing a special power suit created by a full body d scan injecting air into artificial muscles raises his arm even though his own muscles are relaxed the initial goal is to provide support in tasks requiring extended periods of arm raising such as in manufacturing and agriculture with the eventual goal of finding use in care and welfare ishiyama controlling industrial robots is definitely difficult part of the work we re trying to do at the moment is to get a twin armed robot to fold towels but we have so many motors and controlling each of them is a nightmare however if we use virtual reality vr to feed in how to fold then the robot can learn to fold after only a few dozen learning sessions or if we teach it how to assemble ingredients it can make a salad instead of developing each thing individually to move ahead by making robots learn human actions as they are e kagen using ai we can get them to move more smoothly suzumori definitely the intelligence of ai but we need the knowledge of living organisms as well take the sensitive plant mimosa pudica if you touch it it moves almost like doing a bow it isn t like here s the sensor here s the actuator here s the brain it all moves as one without differentiation but to recreate this in a robot we need to think more about fusing and applying other fields ishiyama they say robots will be important in long term care for the elderly but there are two tough problems to overcome the first is that in japan at least the term for long term care for the elderly has only been around for about thirty years while there are all sorts of care methods in other countries its history abroad is short as well and there is no integration of these methods as we have no model for what people should do for other people we are still at the stage of not being able to decide what to have our robots do the second problem is that even if we did have a model we re still at the stage where it is doubtful if we can actually build robots to do the work for example the sense of touch is very important in care but it is something we find very hard to achieve in today s robots if people have a positive experience in touching and being touched by those soft robots you re developing then that will open up the way forward suzumori there is a range of patterns for long term care and welfare robots ai that can communicate in natural language is more widespread and machines that help people rise and sit up or power suits worn by caregivers are more common these days however just slapping sensors on the mechanical devices we ve seen up to now will not make it anything more than a machine one that will not feel pleasant to touch robots like that will not offer well being aren t like that to go a little off topic building robots teaches you about humans and living organisms you learn the answer to questions like why is this muscle located here when you design them you get an intellectual thrill when you realize what nature was intending as an evolutionary response this is absolutely fascinating and i think there s a hint for the future of robotics in there centering humans within robots and ai ishiyama there are probably some aspects where gently moving actuators and sensors also becomes science through a fusion of various fields for example by using deep learning to analyze unstructured data in care giving obtained with cameras we can replace some aspects of care through advancements in robotics i think we will find ourselves in an era when we can achieve well being through science suzumori engineering could be called the history of human development it seems like this is the era when we moved from tools to energy and from engineering for survival to engineering for comfort and prosperity ishiyama that s exactly right i moved from humanities to science at tokyo tech but my impression was that almost all the humanities people were trying to solve social problems using social sciences and failing in contrast i think there s a lot that can be solved through taking a slightly different engineering approach looking at it from an engineering perspective i do feel it is an enjoyable field that gives me a huge sense of satisfaction suzumori i would love for young students to aim for that path if they have the interest but i think another point is that you need to do the field you re good at for example i don t think people should get caught up in popular trends like d printing and drones but only get into them if they are actually good at them and truly want to work on them ishiyama certainly in ai as well you can build a unique position by tackling whatever world you are interested in in my case i m trying to utilize ai in care giving and transforming working styles but with the rise of big data and engineering which haven t yet been very connected with these issues i believe this field will only expand further in the future as for you are there any other things you would like students to keep in mind suzumori in robotics if we have even the slightest feeling that something can t be done that means it absolutely can t be when i said i wanted to make a robot meters long there were some students who were with me and others who said it couldn t be done normally you would assume it is impossible as it would have to be as big and heavy as a crane but we actually made a robot that moves using expanding balloons photos and this is the perfect example of an e kagen robot we had a basis for achieving it and i think that sort of faith is important personally i would actually like to set up an e kagen robots society someday photo a light safe robot arm that extents a total of m using gravity compensation from helium filled film covered balloons as structural materials the arm s joints move using artificial muscles the arm folds up to just about cm in size before expanding and can be easily carried by a single person photo a camera is mounted at the tip of the robot arm this allows it to freely penetrate tall buildings or towers imaging its interior to detect abnormalities where humans cannot easily reach it is expected to find use in initial surveys of disaster sites building inspections and the like ishiyama that sounds like fun i really hope you do set it up if you would let me offer some advice as a tokyo tech graduate i think how students sensors are evolving is important in other words how they view the social needs of robotics and ai science is now entering the era when it will be used to deepen our understanding of the richness and well being of human society globally we re said to be in industry while japan is giving birth to innovation through its own philosophy known as society as society becomes increasingly mature the question is whether we can link science and technology with major social issues i feel that a perspective based on this sort of awareness will become very important for tokyo tech students suzumori as you say placing humans at the center of robotics and ai will lead to well being this is a message i want to pass on to students hoping to join this field or tokyo tech agent based simulation a method to model the agents that carry out autonomous decision making as the fundamental units of a system linking the overall behavior of the system to that of the agents from a bottom up perspective backpropagation in machine learning an algorithm used to make a neural network which is a mathematical model of the neurons in a human brain learn soft robotics a new field of technology that adds the concept of softness to robots which are normally made hard strong and precise the goal is to develop robots that are as flexible as living organisms constraint conditions in a simulation of the movements of an object these define whether each degree of freedom is freely mobile or fixed for example when moving just the knee the hip and ankle are fixed while the knee has a degree of freedom in other words a constraint condition is being applied actuators refers to driving devices that convert energy to linear or rotational movement using hydraulic or electrical motors unstructured data refers to non structured data that lacks a structural definition in the way normal database models have this includes images videos voice documents and so on using unstructured data is often referred to as using big data industry the fourth industrial revolution for manufacturing a concept first raised in germany in an internationally strategic project aimed at creating new business models and values via the digitization of the manufacturing industry society one of the core policies for science and technology measures promoted by the japanese government refers to the new society that will create innovation by incorporating new technologies like iot robots ai and big data into industry and daily life

new theories in disaster prevention a fusion of local and global associate professor hiroshi takagi department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society at the frontier of disaster prevention for asia s coastal areas tsunamis typhoons storm surges these are disasters that affect coastal regions applying a background in coastal and ocean engineering associate professor hiroshi takagi is conducting research critical in preventing disasters both in japan and in developing countries throughout asia with disaster prevention being a topic of global concern we visited the frontier of his research interviewed september asia s developing countries need hybrid approaches hiroshi takagi associate professor department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society graduated from department of civil engineering college of engineering yokohama national university completed graduate study at faculty of engineering yokohama national university joined penta ocean construction co ltd working in institute of technology international divisions group and other groups to research associate faculty of engineering yokohama national university research staff waseda university associate expert japan international cooperation agency jica and others joined tokyo tech in as an associate professor of the department of international development engineering graduate school of science and engineering and has been at his current post since doctor of engineering professional engineer civil engineering laboratory researcher profile disaster prevention research can be broadly categorized into those which study a region s vulnerability to disasters and those which investigate countermeasures many approaches are used including field surveys and computer simulations probability and statistical analyses modeling using experiment flumes and field demonstrations one particular area that takagi focuses on is disaster prevention measures which harmonize with the regional environment i call it a hybrid model i would like to combine modern elements with local elements to develop feasible technology which all in all is useful for preventing disasters takagi in japan a fundamental concept in disaster prevention is to use concrete steel to create strong structures however in asia s developing countries with financial environmental and other constraints alternative solutions must be found one example of a concept rooted in the region is to create ecological buffer zones of mangroves for example in front of and behind dikes instead of relying only on something solid or something flexible the perspective to combine various elements that can each compensate for the others weaknesses as they work in harmony with the environment becomes more indispensable the weaker the financial base of the developing country is explains takagi in thailand which has developed fishing and aquaculture industries bamboo is a traditional technology and there are attempts to utilize bamboo as breakwaters though there are still many failure cases i have hopes that such improvised technology will advance and take root locally as long as there is a process to verify them by applying science and engineering assessment and provide feedback takagi bangladesh which has seen many disasters of even greater severity than those in japan also has disaster prevention measures unique to the region due to constraints in public finances and geological condition robust dikes cannot be simply built instead the way to save lives in times of disaster is to flee just flee to ensure people do not get left behind volunteers lead the elderly to evacuation facilities called cyclone shelters and disaster prevention education in school is very comprehensive such mechanisms and culture to establish fleeing as fundamental knowledge is something japan could learn from that knowledge has developed from experiences over decades of being struck by disasters the reality is that asia with its density of developing countries has a high concentration of disaster sources such as earthquakes typhoons and volcanic eruptions the population is also exceptionally large and concentrated in low lying flat terrain such as islands coastlines and deltas this puts the area at higher risk for coastal disasters than much of the world the five worst coastal disasters in the st century by number of casualties were all in asia and just these produced over casualties five worst coastal disasters in the world since by approximate casualty count indian ocean tsunami indonesia thailand and others persons cyclone nargis myanmar persons great east japan earthquake and tsunami japan persons typhoon haiyan philippines persons cyclone sidr bangladesh persons jakarta indonesia disaster surveys bring researchers face to face with both human frailty and resilience macau china the proliferation of smartphones has made it much easier to access information during a disaster situation philippines interviewing a family who evacuated by walkinged through floodwater of a storm surge mekong vietnam data is not often easy to acquire in developing countries researchers must collect it themselves mekong vietnam accurate topographical surveys are essential in low lying deltas taking time to calibrate instruments hoi an vietnam surveying flood damage at a world heritage site balancing tourism and disaster prevention is a worldwide concern myanmar cyclone survivors of a village some nearby villages were completely wiped out contrary to the high disaster risk the number of people in developing countries researching disaster prevention is extremely low this is dependent on a country s stage of development when the country has little to spare there are not enough public funds to be put toward disaster prevention the environment or other fields which hardly produce direct economic value is anyone able to consider disaster prevention at an early stage of economic development if cities build upon a reliable infrastructure of disaster prevention it leads to sustained development over tens or hundreds of years there are people who have studied in japan and are continuing their research in universities in their home countries if we continue conducting collaborative research with these researchers of asia and accepting international students the pool should grow in to years takagi interdisciplinarity is a must in disaster prevention takagi s various research collaborations with researchers both in japan and abroad are certainly interdisciplinary surveying disaster risks on site requires elements of the natural sciences devising countermeasures requires elements of engineering and the behavior of people during disasters is connected to elements of the social sciences and psychology the range of disciplines involved continues to grow this shows that the field of disaster prevention is inherently large and to study it comprehensively requires an interdisciplinary approach combining the humanities and sciences from a science and engineering perspective solutions are sought by observing natural disasters and expressing their dynamics as physical equations with a completed model predictions can be made though with uncertainty using computer simulations but when we find out one thing we also find many more things we don t know when people flee that involves psychology the environment the society beliefs and even elements of religion this makes modeling very difficult the results from each field coexist and the interesting part of disaster prevention research is to find commonalities or truths among them states takagi for example we know that gravity is the determining factor for some phenomena but we don t know what is at work in determining how people will act we could make a model but there is no way to verify whether it would be correct the good thing about interdisciplinarity is that running out of ideas or stopping to think are not necessarily wrong we can question things or step back and look at everything as a whole being able to distance myself a bit from thinking in terms of science and be humble is something that draws me to interdisciplinary research takagi how people act in disasters varies by country or region and different treatments of men and women based on religious beliefs can create a bias that affects evacuation takagi notes that such differences in values and customs can be discovered by talking with international students regional differences can lead to research in disaster risks an international student from vietnam currently studying in takagi lab is researching typhoons which can arise in the mekong delta lying at the southern end of vietnam the area was hit by a typhoon years ago resulting in approximately casualties surprisingly however its details are mostly unknown even in vietnam this is because no scientific survey was conducted leaving no records as the situation stands it cannot be applied to countermeasures thus risking tremendous damage in the future a similar case occurred in myanmar in with cyclone nargis the cyclone resulted in casualties as a consequence of local inhabitants being completely unaware of such extreme weather events regions which experienced a major disaster attract people materials budgets and progress dramatically in disaster prevention measures on the other hand awareness and interest in disaster prevention remain low in regions which have not experienced major disasters which means no progress is made in implementing countermeasures creating a dilemma that could lead to a major disaster in the future takagi puts much effort into assessing disaster risks in such regions as well international agencies such as the world bank and japan international cooperation agency jica cannot undertake projects without an explicit need their projects are created only when requests or demands are received this research is something only universities can do and i believe it will become a force to draw people s attention and get them to realize that there is a risk takagi though not connected to any needs at first glance basic research by universities becomes an asset for future japan in addition to developing countries in japan with its aging population and low birth rate what should the policy be for maintaining the enormous amount of disaster prevention facilities already built and keeping them for the next generation to this takagi puts forth his hybrid model of disaster prevention with hopes to cultivate ideas and technology first in developing countries using local materials as buffers to prolong the life of actual structures while also continuing to conduct research in universities then once those advances get established we can reimport them back to japan interdisciplinary refers to research and other activities performed across multiple academic fields tacloban philippines people were in the same area at the same time but some survived while others did not what made the difference thailand low cost low environmental burden coastal protection using bamboo collaborative research with a thai university ho chi minh vietnam motorcycles are best for surveying here many local students know the streets well vietnam collaborative research in vietnam using an experiment flume a new facility exemplifying the start of disaster prevention research connecting the local and global for future s sake takagi s work with various sites on disaster prevention while working in the private sector as well as his disaster surveying work in japan and internationally while a research associate at university led him to his research today he even experienced a storm surge in person while working at a harbor construction site and desperately held the office door closed as seawater pounded against it this is why he values the on site perspective he first goes on site and identifies what the problems are then sets his research target while the trend in research is to view things from a global perspective takagi consistently works bottom up starting from the local perspective this stance is alive in his teaching and he brings along students to site surveys as much as possible whether the site is in japan or abroad of course since it is an aspect of education i research security and other factors beforehand and choose the destination with care students accomplish their work at the site and i hope that the experience adds a realistic meaning to their research also we now have several international students in our lab japan is seen particularly by asian countries as a nation that has experienced many disasters and overcome them and that is why people want to come here to study i want to create a place where students from abroad and students from japan are able to form networks wherever they go in the world it will definitely be an asset so i feel it is my calling to host this place where students can connect takagi in addition to going on site to identify risk another practice takagi values is to conduct research that enables him to propose solutions he stresses the importance for researchers to ask themselves how they would survive and to think of specific solutions this interdisciplinary thinking inherent to diversity is a part of the attraction to university research disaster prevention is an expanding academic field so idea generation should be free and varied i belong to the department of transdisciplinary science and engineering which truly has the attitude of let s take on anything i myself still have so many things i want to do and i hope that students will also think for themselves take on many challenges and go out into the world with an open mind for disaster prevention takagi with the number of disasters that occur in asia as well as in other regions the need for disaster prevention research is at a global scale takagi and his students will surely continue applying their interdisciplinary approaches to pioneer disaster prevention rezuanul islam nd year master s student department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society toward undiscovered causes of storm surge i experienced the damage caused by cyclone sidr when i was a high school student in bangladesh and after graduating from university i spent two years working in disaster risk reduction later i decided to go abroad to enrich my knowledge and chose japan a country advanced in applied disaster prevention i ended up in takagi lab because i acknowledged its concept of reducing natural disaster risk in coastal areas the generally accepted theory of storm surge specifies that a low pressure system like typhoons results in strong wind which pushes water onshore and causes anomalous sea water level rise however by taking into account typhoon forward speed size coastal geometry and other storm parameters we found substantial cause effect relationships while each discovery was significant enough a very few researchers had contributed before and it is expected to be a new insight in improving storm surge forecasting my current research aims to reduce typhoon risk in coastal areas by finding out the undiscovered causes of extreme storm surge i strongly believe that my research initiative will contribute in the disaster management sector of bangladesh as well as other countries of the world prof takagi my supervisor has influenced me the most and always gives me constructive advice and motivation i m learning many things from him including how important it is to connect my knowledge and experiences by surveying coastal areas and publishing scientific papers i would like to remain at the university researching teaching and contributing to the field of preventing coastal disasters shota kurobe nd year master s student department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society with understanding of the region highlight grassroots disaster prevention when i was an undergraduate i was in the department of international development engineering which looked at how to interact with developing countries worldwide i then took some time off and visited about countries and i realized that i wanted to use my skills more for disaster prevention to safeguard people s lives rather than for development that s why i knocked on the door at takagi lab i m currently studying typhoon haiyan which occurred in the philippines in though a storm surge was foreseen it still resulted in a great deal of harm one of the reasons for this was that there was no local word for storm surge and evacuation was delayed so i am using results from storm surge analyses including site survey data to simulate evacuation and determine how people can be evacuated more safely including where to locate evacuation centers and when to sound evacuation warnings takagi sensei often tells us that universities the academic side must do grassroots research and he is a powerful force in site surveys in april next year i will start working at a company which provides governmental support for disaster prevention in developing countries i intend to apply what i have learned at takagi lab in terms of both knowledge and

dance and planetary science wonders of the universe planetary science professor shigeru ida has devoted his career to exploring the origin of the earth and life in the universe and yuko okubo has spent her life exploring our world through dance we asked these two friends to talk about their connection with the world from the different perspectives of their chosen professions held on december at ookayama campus physicality okubo i was fortunate enough to meet professor ida about a year ago thank you so much for having me here today ida since i was introduced to okubo san and others by a science communicator at the national museum of emerging science and innovation miraikan we have had dinner with the same group of individuals every year it has been a wonderful opportunity to share what we have been doing in our various fields okubo i visited your laboratory once with dancers and a musician and i remember very well seeing a butoh poster on a wall it struck me as a sign of your unique sensibility were you always interested in dance shigeru ida professor earth life science institute ida yes since i was a college student in kyoto i believe you came to my laboratory because you wanted to talk with me for a book you were writing on dance and physics while physics is not my main area of current expertise we talked about a range of topics and i tried to give you my view as a scientist what got you thinking about science okubo physical lines are very important in dance they are the border between the outside world and the dancer i studied ballet in my childhood and shifted to contemporary dance as i grew during this time i began searching for movements that would make it possible to go beyond these lines i looked first through dance and then sought answers in other areas at a certain point i felt that the answer may lie in the overlapping area between art and science not long after we met it hit me that i should see you to explore this when i look back at that time i wonder if you thought i was a little bit odd ida people often say that art and science have much in common once i began looking into it seriously though i found that they were actually quite different and that scientists see the world from a different perspective than artists do but i found it quite exhilarating to explore different ways of approaching questions okubo it was the same for me it was my first glimpse into how scientists approach questions and the differences in thinking between these approaches ida when i talked with you i got a sense of the importance of physicality in art those of us in space science rarely consider physicality because the methodologies of basic science tend to eliminate such factors in reality however scientists are human and i think it is impractical to ignore physicality completely when discussing space my book the solar system and planets beyond talks about science in the sky and science toward human science in the sky explores the origin of the universe black holes gravitational waves and ten dimensional string theory while science toward human explores medicine the environment and so forth because my background is in physics and geoscience i felt a sense of incongruity my discussions with you however highlighted the varied perspectives in different fields becoming conscious of this caused me to see the importance of physicality and it was this that led me to science from human our understanding after all comes through our body and this made me realize that we are ultimately connected in ways that reach beyond the physical okubo does this mean that you have come to understand who you are and that the satisfaction you find in your work stems from this understanding ida what you tell me helps me to understand the priority that performers must place on their physical presence scientists strive to eliminate subjectivity but i realized by talking to you that objectivity is important in performance as well dance science and the world yuko okubo contemporary dancer ida you also wrote a book kathy s new dimension after you published the book i understand that you held a performance that developed through your association with an ascetic buddhist monk could you tell me a little about that okubo while searching for new ways to express my art i sought to learn from individuals who are deeply connected to the origin of japanese arts here my interest shifted from the scientific to the roots of my art because i had always looked at myself objectively in my search for balance and i felt the answer may lie in something beyond this you expressed this sense very well and i was happy because i felt that it helped me to understand myself ida my impression about you is that you express your world using your body as a tool if my impression is correct we scientists do the same we attempt to understand phenomenon utilizing knowledge techniques and tools and express what we understand in different forms this approach is very similar to what you are doing okubo yes in fact i express the present moment through contemporary dance using my body as an instrument throughout my development my involvement in dance has gradually changed when i was little it was simply fun to dance as i grew the meaning of dance evolved within me and now i enjoy it because dance gives me a great chance to share my expression to the outside world ida i see i also think the same way we scientists are often asked why we conduct research the most common reason given is our desire to know for me the reason is because i want to be linked to the world when i was little my sense of isolation was cured by visits to the public library it was there that the books i read connected me to the world around me okubo that s an interesting look into the experience that formed you as an adult i think this is the first time i heard you talk about your childhood ida then i was introduced to physics a field i would continue to study throughout my time at college it was the first time that i felt truly connected to the world there are generally two types of scientists one is the individual who likes to observe nature and conduct experiments however a certain percentage of scientists are not interested in doing that at all there are a great many astronomers who have never observed the stars okubo really ida yes i believe that s true in many ways those people are interested in the structure and origin of universe in basic science we are not always concerned with clear goals because definite goals limit us and because it s the unexpected discoveries that often lead to the biggest advances many scientists simply let their interests take them wherever they may lead and most scientists continue looking for new areas to explore currently the earth life science institute elsi has advanced collaborative projects with young creators in a wide range of fields i am also participating in these projects okubo i don t often get much of a chance to work with people in different fields it must be very exciting although i imagine that the different perspectives from various fields create barriers ida i notice differences in the approaches taken by creators and scientists and want to use the advantages in these differences in communication among scientists however it is not always easy because my background did not train me to express myself based on my bodyas when providing scientific information it is meaningless to simply show results what is important is to consider how to communicate our understanding of the phenomena and what that understanding means in this collaboration i have sought to address this okubo it is very useful to approach things from the different perspectives that creators have scientists are often thought to be inflexible but this is not true at all ida yes i think this is because scientists are very careful about the language they use being extremely difficult to prove something completely scientists tend to avoid stating clearly what things are therefore we tend to use a range of expressions that nuance our communication but what we say is not always communicated well okubo you mean expressions like perhaps and we cannot completely rule out the possibility laughter ida conclusions in papers are expressed using terms such as could would may and might it s not that we mean to be overly vague it s that we want to communicate our ideas carefully and accurately that s not to say that we couldn t improve our ability to do this though observing extrasolar planets ida discussions on the formation of planets have changed significantly before the solar system was the only one example of planetary systems we knew okubo wow i m surprised our knowledge is so recent ida since thousands of exoplanets have been discovered and along with these discoveries the resolution of our observations and the focus of our approaches have changed significantly we had a theory to explain the configuration of the planets in the solar system however the majority of the thousands of exoplanetary systems we have since discovered have configurations that are quite different from our solar system this new knowledge was really beyond what we had expected we could not apply our existing theory of planet formation and had to start from scratch okubo that must have been quite a stumbling block how did you react ida we were completely shocked at first and then were super happy when we realized that everyone both those with long careers in astronomy and young researchers alike were at the threshold of an entirely new and very exciting era of discovery we were provided observation data and already had basic tools of planet formation although the tools were applied only for the solar system it was great fun for me my mind was filled with new ideas that i thought could be applied to the creation of a model capable of explaining the solar system and a wide variety of exoplanetary systems new mysteries kept arising through discussions that allowed all sorts of possibilities okubo were there any major technological innovations that have helped to discover new planets ida no our thinking was confined to what we had known rather than what we were learning the technology that first allowed us to observe extrasolar planets had already been established in the s however astronomers failed to apply it the problem was that they only knew about our solar system and they were inclined to only think in terms of variations of what they knew jupiter orbits the sun every years and saturn takes years we were looking for planets with orbits of to years however the first planet discovered had an orbit of only four days okubo only four days being so different it must have been hard to find ida it was necessary to eliminate noise from the observational data in order to see through to the signals we were looking for some suspected however that the noise itself included signals and it was confirmed that it did after this scientists reanalyzed old data and discovered many signals since then equipment specifically designed to detect these signals has been developed and observation technology has improved significantly okubo once you find a target then is it generally the case that accuracy tends to increase if so exploring different approaches to locate stars may be fruitful ida that s exactly right new approaches to observation have been proposed approaches which look for such things as doppler changes in fixed stars eclipses of central stars by planets and optical distortions due to the gravitational pull of planets technology has also improved such as the shift from coaxial cable to optical fiber and the capability to maintain temperature within degrees these accumulated improvements have made it possible to get highly accurate observations some thought it would be impossible to discover something as large as the earth and others thought it would take a years to discover a planet in the end it actually took about only years okubo recent progress in scientific technology has been very quick information can be shared instantly through the internet anyone using a computer knows what i m talking about ida as the speed of our data computations and simulations improves the pace of our research also improves we can now recognize the varieties of exoplanetary systems and consider the possibility of planets that harbor life optical doppler effect doppler effect is a shift in the frequency or length of a wave including sound and electromagnetic waves for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave one example is an ambulance siren when a siren is approaching us its pitch sounds higher and when it is moving away from us its pitch sounds lower a similar effect is observed with light stars moving toward us look blueish and stars moving away from us look reddish color changes depending on the frequency finding extraterrestrial life a new academic pursuit okubo it is fantastic to think about life on other planets ida astronomers are now paying attention to planets that move around red dwarf stars that emit infrared radiation we think life may exist on such planets oceans may exist but the environment is completely different from that of the earth planets moving around red dwarf tars are easy to observe and they also emit strong x rays and ultraviolet rays in such an environment life may evolve although we initially imagined environments on planets with life to be similar to earth s we are now seeking environments that are completely different from ours okubo how do you determine the potential for life on other planets when they are so far away ida we examine the composition of the atmosphere using telescopes oxygen on earth is discharged by plants and bacteria as a waste product of photosynthesis we are now thinking about what else we can derive from the atmospheres of other planets the european southern observatory eso announced about a year ago that a planet located light years away may be of similar size to the earth and may have oceans utilizing current nanotechnology it is possible to send a camera to the exoplanet by installing it on a cm microchip and using a laser to accelerate it to of the speed of light for the journey it would take years to arrive at the planet and then another years to receive the photos taken there okubo you mean if we send the camera now we d get photos from the planet in years it seems that planetary science has been making great progress since ida ten years after was also an important year in the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa saturn probe cassini was sent to observe saturn s rings it discovered geyser out from the surface of enceladus one of saturn s moons the surface of enceladus is covered with ice water jetting out from cracks showed that its internal temperature is very high the water also contained organic substances in other words enceladus has a warm underground ocean where life may exist okubo discussions on the origin of life are so fascinating and listening to this story at elsi makes it is even more exciting ida the mission of elsi is to seek the origin of the earth and life and the discovery of exoplanets has helped advance our knowledge it s the same for life the genetic codes for all life on earth bacteria trees animals and humankind are very close that is we share a common ancestor while the number of amino acids is countless the same amino acids form the building blocks of both humans and bacteria in other words we only know one type of life okubo i see knowing only one type it is hard to consider others i guess it s the same with our model of the solar system isn t it ida it is the discovery of creatures with different structures on saturn s moons moon enceladus and jupiter s moon europa and our observation of extrasolar planetsexoplanets help us in our search for the origin of life on earth the scientific progress gives us the means to demonstrate theories that will become common knowledge this is the stage we are at now scientists work together to establish research institutes like elsi which was founded ahead of others around the world to focus on research into the origin of life in the field of space biologyastrobiology an area that has shown remarkable advancements the national institutes of natural sciences astrobiology center was established in mitaka city tokyo a few years ago and similar research institutes will be founded as work in this exciting field progresses proof and repeatabilityreproductivility are essential because quite simply if something can t be demonstrated then it isn t science when i was a college student for example even evolution of life was not yet considered science as we found more and more evidence however we were able to demonstrate the validity of the theory okubo right and it s become an important academic field now with these advances we may discover the origin of life in the near future ida yes i expect we will see a rapid expansion in our knowledge about the origin of life okubo listening to you makes my earlier thoughts about dance and the world seem childishly simple you ve helped me to realize that following our interests is the most valuable thing to do ida people are enthusiastic about the things that interest them of course different people are interested in widely different things but being enthusiastic about something no matter what it may be is very exciting i enjoyed talking with you today i want students studying planetary science to become familiar with different ways of thinking shigeru ida professor earth life

affective engineering meets japanese tea ceremony associate professor c line mougenot proposes future oriented devices that rely on user centered design grand master sojitsu kobori carries forward the spirit of japanese tea ceremony through a deep understanding of the guest s feeling the two shared a peaceful moment to contemplate how they turn awareness of human emotion into practical and artistic expression date july at enshu sado school in shinjuku tokyo space a dimension of communication deeply rooted in japanese tradition kobori dr mougenot what does japanese tea ceremony mean to you mougenot completely organized methods and movements which i think are also very common in traditional japanese dance and martial arts kobori yes that is very perceptive enshu kobori the founder of our tea school practiced the art of tea with the spirit of wabi established by sen no rikyu and developed it into buke sado a form of tea ceremony practiced by edo period warriors he added beauty brightness and affluence to the spirit of wabi sabi to create an aesthetic of grace simplicity and objective beauty which is known as kirei sabi the way of tea practiced by warriors emphasized the spirit expressed through our bodies much like martial arts do the ceremony itself includes elements of japanese classical arts such as noh which prioritizes space and breathing mougenot what do you mean by space kobori different cultures view space differently the japanese have developed a way of recognizing space between individuals when communicating this space does not emphasize distance per se but instead expresses a humble respect for others mougenot that must be the cluster system we set up for basic research on tsubame kobori during a tea ceremony when facing a guest the host first places a fan in front of him or herself to set a boundary with the guest and then bows the host then removes the fan to eliminate the boundary with this both are ready to enjoy conversation this setting of a boundary is also a way of expressing respect for the guest mougenot europeans and americans shake hands and hug when they meet kobori when you and i are talking we sometimes continue without pauses and at other times take a moment to collect our thoughts before continuing that moment or space allows a certain calmness a tranquility that is emphasized in tea ceremony as a sign of respect and a means of enhancing the time spent together as you noted the spirit of japanese martial arts is very similar to that of tea ceremony the space during a tea ceremony resembles the engagement distance in a kendo bout or the warm up ritual that precedes every sumo match these spaces or intervals are not intended to express hostility but rather to show respect for the opponent mougenot that is a wonderful way of thinking integrating function and affectivity in engineering and tea kobori in tea ceremony i focus on the happiness of my counterparts i strive to create an atmosphere suitable for individual guests to serve delicious tea and to ensure enjoyable conversation all designed to provide a pleasant experience mougenot i carry that same spirit in my research in the fields of affective engineering and interaction design i apply scientific approaches to research the emotional aspects of individuals who use smart phones and other communication devices product development in engineering often prioritizes function however the primary feature of my research is the focus on affectivity on the joy and excitement people experience when using these devices to achieve this i have expanded beyond the boundary of engineering to include art psychology sociology and marketing in my work kobori function and affectivity you say these are also important themes in tea ceremony for example i design tea bowls of course when i view the tea bowl as a tool for the ceremony i strive for a perfect design however i entrust the user of the tea bowl to complete the final step of perfection mougenot how do you do that kobori a tea bowl is used to prepare tea for a guest but the emotion and spirit of the individual user is the final touch to each bowl in fact the tea bowls i design are sometimes valued by their users in very unexpected ways which is always a pleasant surprise may i ask what scientific approaches you utilize when researching people s emotions mougenot it is as you say scientific research so i begin by collecting plenty of objective data data on facial expressions blood pressure perspiration and the like i then use computers to analyze this data and attempt to clarify how people use their brain body and senses when they come into contact with different products kobori how do you apply the findings of your research to society mougenot modern society has reached a stage where all sorts of things are virtualized instead of writing letters by hand for example we have come to use email almost exclusively these developments have greatly reduced opportunities for us to use our bodies and senses individuality has been lost computer fonts do not have individuality my research aims to develop devices that deeply appeal to our bodies and senses and provide us with more enjoyment during use kobori a kind of thoughtful hospitality provided by devices that is very interesting mougenot what impresses me is that tea masters understand their guests emotions so thoroughly it seems they are able to read them with great accuracy and tend to their individual needs only without any help from data or computers utilized by scientists kobori we use the knowledge we accumulate from experience by carefully considering the feelings of others we are sensitive to the slightest changes in facial expressions and movements of the mind while making tea and conversing with our guests we remain highly aware of the mood i have developed this affectivity through the practice of tea one important barometer we use to understand people s feelings is the space i mentioned earlier mougenot space and mood i am learning the depth of many japanese concepts today kobori uses saint louis crystal for the tea to show hospitality to his french guest designing pleasure through attentiveness to others mougenot i know there are many specific rules in tea ceremony can we enjoy it even if we do not know these rules kobori of course you can while these rules are important it is more important to enjoy the tea itself when we decide on wine at a restaurant we first ask the sommelier for a recommendation we then taste the wine and enjoy the food and company of those with us basically tea ceremony is not any different mougenot if that is the case then i am confident i can enjoy tea ceremony too kobori i have no doubt attentiveness to others around you is important and these rules exist to make that attentiveness easier in tea ceremony we also respect the tools we use we hold the tea bowl with our hands feel it with our lips and enjoy the different textures of pottery lacquerware glass and wood this may be a unique japanese way developed over time to show respect to the items we use daily these tools may also have cracks and blemishes we revere such defects and through conversation with our guests find pleasure in turning these seemingly negative characteristics into positive ones mougenot that s a very interesting perspective when we design devices texture is also an important element traditionally engineering has focused on realizing advanced technology in products with little attention paid to how people actually use these products thankfully this is changing one reason for the rapid increase in smart phones and tablets is that we can feel the texture of the product and enjoy the intuitive movements we make with our fingers i believe we have reached a point where designing a pleasurable user experience is as important as developing the functions of a device kobori designing pleasure i agree with you the harmony of people tools hanging scrolls flowers conversation the sound of boiling water and making tea these all contribute to the grace of a tea ceremony for people whose lives are shaped by information overload and lack of time spending a moment in the serene dignified atmosphere of a tea ceremony is a good chance to reflect on the importance of simplicity and on oneself mougenot emotional exchange between the host and guests to create a comfortable atmosphere that sounds like affective engineering it is a wonderful surprise to learn that the way of tea with its long history is similar to the research i engage in i cannot help but feel that there are many aspects of tea ceremony that i agree with knowing that the concept of up to date engineering design so closely resembles the thoughtful hospitality you extend to your guests provides me with great inspiration which i will surely share with my students kirei sabi haber and bosch established the first method of ammonia synthesis that directly synthesized airborne hydrogen and nitrogen this is often called the haber bosch hb process haber received the nobel prize in chemistry in for his research on ammonia synthesis research and bosch received the prize in for the high pressure reaction process he developed affective engineering first established in japan affective engineering has expanded throughout the world this field of study focuses on the measurement of emotional response and the application of the results of such measurements to the process of design based on the perspective of engineering affective engineering seeks to clarify people s sensibility from a wide range of approaches including psychology sociology aesthetics semiology and marketing c line mougenot associate professor school of engineering sojitsu kobori the th grand master of the enshu sado school kobori has published several books in his newest work five senses in japan he describes japanese aesthetic perception from the viewpoint of tea ceremony while taking into account the five senses which have been valued in japan since ancient times in my father is the grand master a documentary featuring enshu kobori was screened in japan

atom engineering from all solid state batteries to room temperature superconductivity professor taro hitosugi s work in all solid state batteries has gained attention as a path to the next generation of higher safety faster recharge batteries using cutting edge technology capable of touching individual atoms hitosugi s group is focusing on research that only his group can accomplish we interviewed hitosugi and two of his students focusing on research that only we can accomplish taro hitosugi professor school of materials and chemical technology faculty of graduate majors in chemical science and engineering materials science and engineering bachelor of engineering department of applied chemistry the university of tokyo doctor of engineering department of superconductivity the university of tokyo joined sony corporation assistant professor department of chemistry the university of tokyo after serving as associate professor at advanced institute for materials research aimr tohoku university assumed the current post laboratory researcher profile when we open the door to hitosugi s office we see open space leading to a window at the end of the room although most offices at universities are filled with bookshelves large desks and partitions this room is separated into three areas a counter table by the window low chairs and cushions a large thin monitor and a round meeting table it is a simple but relaxing atmosphere i want students to be relaxed and enjoy their time here says hitosugi with a smile his favorite spot is the counter by the window from which he has a lovely view looking down a hill good ideas don t usually occur sitting at a desk good ideas usually occur while watching beautiful scenery relaxing and chatting explains hitosugi in this comfortable environment he often asks students in all the world what is it that only you can accomplish the work by his group in all solid state batteries has garnered much attention with expectation to bring forth the next generation in batteries applying approaches that in all the world only they can accomplish hitosugi s group is advancing the cutting edge of their field adoption on the horizon for all solid state batteries among commercially available secondary i e rechargeable batteries lithium ion batteries have the highest energy density fast charging time and long operating life this has led to their wide adoption from smartphones to automobiles as well balanced rechargeable batteries however the wider commercialization of electric vehicles evs requires lithium ion batteries with a larger capacity longer travel distance and fast charging time on the order of minutes such batteries will also allow us to use tablets and smartphones which consume large amounts of energy without having to carry mobile batteries demand for lithium ion batteries continues to expand however automobile electronics and chemical manufacturers are already moving forward in the development of new generation secondary batteries because of this all solid state batteries are being seen as the successor to the huge market currently dominated by lithium ion batteries at tokyo tech hitosugi and professor ryoji kanno are collaborating with automobile manufacturers advancing in their respective research towards commercialization for hitosugi s research in particular the keyword is interface the structure of existing lithium ion batteries involves a liquid electrolyte between positive and negative electrodes movement of lithium between the two electrodes leads to repeated charge and discharge however this structure increases the risk of leakage of the liquid electrolyte which in turn can lead to ignition of the battery in fact fires have been caused by lithium ion batteries in personal computers and smarphones the all solid state battery was developed to replace the liquid electrolyte with a solid material that has a low risk of ignition its key features include safety reduced charging time a few seconds to a few minutes and capability of long use however one of the challenges with this battery was that the interface resistance increased even when using materials with low electric resistance basic understanding of interface resistances has not yet been fully realized we didn t know for example that interface resistances of solid state batteries could be lower than that of lithium ion batteries using liquid electrolytes in this sense we took a step forward into the unknown describes hitosugi hitosugi succeeded in proving that very low resistances could be achieved at electrode and electrolyte interfaces shutting out impurities completely and using thin film technology opened up the understanding of all solid state batteries furthermore he developed equipment that could quantitatively evaluate the battery properties many of the experiment devices used for this study were not commercial general purpose equipment but were developed by his team this is one of the unique characteristics of research conducted by hitosugi s group making our own experimental apparatuses is not to cut costs hitosugi says with a laugh commercial equipment only allows us to conduct research similar to what other researchers do we are trying to do something special that we alone can accomplish therefore it is natural for us to develop our own equipment this system made it possible to manufacture and evaluate thin film all solid state batteries in an ultra high vacuum samples are never exposed to air lithium ion battery all solid state battery the developed thin film solid state batteries exhibited one fifth to one tenth the interface resistance of conventional batteries using liquid electrolytes in collaboration with semiconductor and automobile manufacturers they are now working toward the near future commercialization of ultra high performance all solid state batteries the experimental thin film all solid state batteries batteries structure of a thin film all solid state battery cross sectional view a hybrid of solid state electrochemistry and solid state physics besides all solid state batteries the group also works on research and development of ultra low power consumption memory however they do not focus solely on applied research the foundation of atom engineering is basic research on atomic behaviors interactions and properties of aggregations created by atomic binding when hitosugi was a university student he observed atoms through a scanning tunneling microscope noting they were lined up so beautifully on the surface of silicon they looked like a picture i was so moved by the power of nature that experience stayed with me our research is to listen to the voice of nature discover unknown properties of substances and create novel functions and materials cutting edge measurement technology makes it possible to fabricate products by confirming the individual characteristics of atoms the development of the thin film all solid state batteries mentioned earlier is also an extension of this using solid state electrochemistry and our knowledge of solid physics we evaluate physical properties this is the strength and the originality of our group what hitosugi is looking ahead to following the development of all solid state batteries and ultra low power consumption memory is superconductors which he worked on during his graduate school days superconductivity has the potential to change the future researchers around the world have sought room temperature superconductivity and the hitosugi group is now attempting to advance development through their unique approaches photo and show the sputtering system to deposit thin films sputtering is a type of metal plating in which inactive gases are discharged at high voltage to deposit a film of the target substance onto the substrate what is seen through the observation window is the discharge of inactive gas argon gas reinventing japanese innovation research by hitosugi s group is a combination of basic and applied research founded on solid state electrochemistry and solid state physics while an undergraduate hitosugi was greatly into playing rugby in graduate school he worked on superconductivity research but after finishing graduate school he wanted to develop products that many people would use and chose to work for sony corporation i never thought about becoming a researcher when i was a graduate student at sony i was first in charge of development of ultrahigh density optical disks and later i chose marketing and sales we developed new technologies which brought us new products to deliver to our customers i was able to experience the processes of world class companies looking back at that time i was grateful to have had such a meaningful experience which cultivated the ability to foresee the future beyond the technologies states hitosugi by rediscovering the value of research through his work at sony hitosugi decided to return to academia and become a researcher when he was years old he explains i will do what i want to do most this is my motto at times i was at a loss because it was difficult after jumping into a new field however i know it is much better to try what i want to do than to regret not having tried moving to different fields allows you to create a firm base built by accumulating experiences that are different for each person this gives birth to a researcher s individuality he further states one of the many things i want to do now is to start an industrial revolution at the lab for example to find the best materials for electrodes and electrolytes in all solid state batteries he made a robot scientist system with artificial intelligence that automatically produces and evaluates thin films setting raw ingredients this system automatically fabricates thin films and measures the physical properties utilizing robot arms in a vacuum what researchers then need to do is to check and analyze the results photos and the st step to the industrial revolution at a laboratory a robot scientist system that combines thin film production and evaluation devices robot arm installed in the system operates automatically in the ultra high vacuum since japan is experiencing a rapid change in its population structure with a low birthrate the number of researchers specializing in science and engineering is also declining in the midst of the fierce competition in science and technology fields depending on manpower for research does not help a country like japan when competing against countries with larger populations like china says hitosugi of course he also places much emphasis on educating the next generation of researchers who will be the future torchbearers for science and technology in japan hitosugi explains i always encourage students to do what they want to do it s natural to feel fear in doing something new it requires courage but i want students to develop the independence to overcome such difficulties i want young people to be open minded and not set limits on themselves it is a waste for young people to decide what they can t do because they have unlimited potential being free from such limitations you will find what only you can accomplish as a researcher and educator hitosugi is always looking to the future of each student and the future of innovation in japan that young people will bring mr hitosugi i learn a lot from him as a researcher naoto nakamura st year master s student department of chemical science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology i am researching all solid state batteries i hope to identify the origin of interface resistance utilizing promising positive materials other than lithium cobaltite the reason i joined hitosugi san s group was my interest in atoms which combine to generate physical properties and my hope to make discoveries that can change the world i also like making things so i was very happy to know that i would be developing my own experiment equipment too hitosugi san is a very enthusiastic researcher and by his policy we address one another using informal titles he insists on everyone being treated equally which really appeals to me hitosugi san s lectures are always fun and interesting his lectures motivate me to work on research that interests me without being put off by potential difficulties i really enjoy being here because i m learning so much from him the great balance of freedom and seriousness is the attraction of this study group igseon gu th year undergraduate student department of chemical engineering school of engineering when i was in my third year as an undergraduate at tokyo tech i attended a presentation given by hitosugi san about his life as a researcher the presentation intrigued me greatly so i decided to join his group when i visited his office i felt an open mindedness and individuality that was different from other labs after joining in addition to the free and open atmosphere that i had seen when i first visited i found that everyone in the group was very serious about research i was sure that it would be a good place for me to grow i am looking forward to getting involved in the applied research that our group has been working on research such as all solid state batteries and memory this year while i am still an undergraduate i want to learn as much as i can about atom engineering through basic research on hydrides what hitosugi san teaches us students is easy to understand and shows empathy he gives great advice that is very useful to our future my only disappointment is that i am the only female student here laughs i want more girls to be interested in this field published
fastest crawl stroke in two years the summer olympics will be hosted by tokyo where the ookayama campus is located among the olympic events swimming is one of the most popular sports the crawl is especially popular because it is the fastest of the swimming events identifying the most efficient crawl stroke has long been the dream of researchers research results have attracted attention as a potential path to the realization of this dream and tokyo tech s motomu nakashima laboratory has played an important role in this research released in january professor motomu nakashima developed a swimming humanoid robot with graduate students back when he was an associate professor studies on swimming are traditionally carried out by performing measurements on actual swimmers during these studies however reproduction of human movements was difficult because they vary according to the physical characteristics of individual swimmers this swimming humanoid robot made it possible to perceive changes in propulsive force caused by slight differences in movement which advanced the clarification of swimming mechanisms significantly an actual swimmer s physical constitution was captured by three dimensional scanner and reproduced in half scale s stroke or i stroke motomu nakashima professor school of engineering tokyo tech systems and control engineering graduate major department of systems and control engineering graduated from the tokyo tech school of engineering department of mechanical engineering obtained his doctorate from the tokyo tech graduate school of science and engineering joined the faculty at the tokyo tech school of engineering as an assistant after serving as a visiting researcher at the naval postgraduate school monterey and assistant professor at the tokyo tech graduate school of information science and engineering he was promoted to professor at the tokyo tech school of engineering laboratory researcher profile in freestyle swimming competition the crawl is the preferred stroke because it is the fastest the crawl is also taught at swimming schools and in p e classes it is however one of the more difficult strokes comparing advanced swimmers with beginners the difference in the smoothness of stroke that is the continuous movement of each arm to propel the body forward is significant basically the crawl is a combination of the strokes and kicks strokes determine the speed and are classified into s and i shape pulls the i stroke pulls linearly under the water this style was the trend before the munich olympics american swimmer mark spitz broke one world record after another to win seven gold medals in the freestyle and butterfly events he broke the olympic record for the most medals won by a single athlete he used s strokes which pull water in an s shape below the body after this everyone started using the s stroke it was ian thorpe who changed the trend after winning several gold medals during the sydney olympics and athens olympics he used the straight i stroke to great advantage and reignited the debate about which was the best stroke being away from the debate i have carried out research to clarify the mechanisms of swimming using dynamic approaches said professor nakashima the crawl evolved into its current style only about years ago since the style has been never completely standardized the debate about efficiency has been ongoing i simply thought that carrying out research to clarify the mechanisms of the arm movements that propel the body forward and the mechanisms of water flow around the swimmer would lead to the most efficient and fastest swimming style the difference between s and i strokes is the vortex generated around hands swumanoid reproduces the physical forms and motions of the actual swimmer and realizes realistic swimming motions utilizing all joints of its body professor nakashima participated in joint research with five researchers both in japan and overseas including professor hideki takagi at tsukuba university they attempted multilateral approaches to identify the fastest crawl stroke applying the most advanced flow measurement and analysis technology and simulations using swimming humanoid robots in january the long awaited results of this study were released the results show that the s stroke achieves propulsive force with less power which is effective in mid and long distance swimming events requiring efficiency m and longer while the i stroke is effective in short distance swimming events requiring absolute speed rather than efficiency m these differences are also shown by the vortex generated around the hands in both crawl strokes in the s stroke the vortex generated when turning the palm over creates significant lifting force meanwhile in the i stroke the vortex generated on both sides of the hands creates propulsive force the influence the different vortexes exert on the mechanism of propulsive force in crawl strokes was clarified for the first time of the world the results of this study did not simply suggest whether the i or s stroke should be chosen for the fastest speed but also suggested that these two strokes should be applied depending on the distance as well as the physical constitution and muscle strength of the individual swimmer human swimming motions vary and exhibit complex flow phenomena which have not yet been clarified completely we need to conduct further research to clarify the mechanisms we will continue our research on swimming styles with a focus on individual differences in physical constitution muscle strength and swimming skill swimming simulation and swimming humanoids professor nakashima wanted to quantify the sense that expert swimmers have as a principle and mechanism with data acquired from experiments and simulations this motivated him to conduct research on swimming styles there were some studies focusing on specific parts of the body such as the hand however no one had examined the entire body because it was a largely unexplored field it was more of a challenge but this made it all the more interesting for me i am not a good swimmer however so from the start i wanted to work with researchers familiar with the sport said professor nakashima he joined the japanese society of sciences in swimming and water exercise as well as the japan society of mechanical engineering to become familiar with others doing research on competitive swimming tsukuba university s professor takagi a member of the joint research team for this study was a water polo player in his school days and he now coaches the university s water polo club he has also served as the coach for the men s national water polo team so he is an expert using his well developed sense of swimming and water polo he has worked on practical research in biomechanics related to competitive swimming and research in flow dynamics he brought both knowledge and practical experience to this project the simulation model and swimming humanoid robot developed by nakashima laboratory reinforced this knowledge and experience to enable them to achieve their goal the simulation model that professor nakashima developed is called swum and the software is called swumsuit these made it possible to analyze the dynamics of swimming this included the changes in fluid forces and body motions generated by differences in form that influence each body part this software can simulate four swimming styles the crawl breast stroke back stroke and butterfly in addition to its standard ability to simulate body motion the most recent version of swum is capable of musculo skeletal simulation that clarifies the power that each muscle exerts another important tool this research group has in its corner is swumanoid a swimming humanoid robot an actual swimmer s physical constitution was captured by three dimensional scanner and reproduced in half scale utilizing computer control a total of waterproof motors are used to move all of the joints on the body which enables the complex motions used in actual swimming the mechanisms of the vortexes that s and i strokes generated were clarified using underwater robots such as swumnoid in a large water flow tank at tsukuba university this is an analysis diagram of the crawl utilizing swum the red lines shown from the body indicate the fluid forces influencing each part of the body swum can simulate all of the skeletal muscles used while swimming it is capable of simulating four swimming styles the crawl breast stroke back stroke and butterfly energy that shifts human interests toward research it is hard to describe the nakashima laboratory in a word it is divided into three sections sports engineering which looks at sports from the perspective of engineering biomechanics which applies mechanical dynamics methodology to the human body and biorobotics which produced swumanoid our principle is to apply conventional mechanical engineering add the perspective of information and clarify a wide range of as yet unknown issues regarding human bodies professor nakashima was once a tokyo tech student while enrolled here he started studying swimming mechanisms in fish and dolphins about years ago he started focusing on human swimming when i was a high school student i liked physics and mathematics but at the university i wanted to do something that would be useful to people and society rather than simply study physics and mathematics for their own sake for this reason i chose mechanical dynamics for my graduation thesis my advisor suggested that i do research on fish and dolphin swimming mechanics i took his suggestion because it sounded very interesting to me the graduation thesis for his undergraduate program became the foundation for his current research on swimming and resulted in a great achievement nakashima s laboratory has been working on a wide range of research themes related to swimming themes such as throwing motion in water polo swimming by individuals with prosthesis and swimwear for those who are not good at swimming he also carries out joint research with a bathtub manufacturer on how people in the bath strain their muscles it is very interesting we are not completely relaxed in the bath we usually strain our body muscles unconsciously to prevent ourselves from drowning we examine how we strain our muscles through simulations using swum the results may lead to the development of a completely safe and comfortable bathtub professor nakashima is driven by curiosity about the principles and theories of human motion his enthusiasm attracts students who are interested in the relationship among nature technology and humans chie nemoto nd year master s student department of mechanical and control engineering graduate school of science and engineering tokyo tech while i was an undergraduate i worked on satellites after i entered the graduate school though i wanted to work on issues that were more closely related to humans this is why i chose professor nakashima as my advisor my research theme is swimming stokes in persons with disabilities i had almost no knowledge about swimming but with the help of professor nakashima i have had the chance to meet with many paralympic swimmers and coaches they have all helped me to advance my research and i truly feel that i am engaged in something that will help people he s always available and we can consult with him about anything he likes research so much shota ito th year undergraduate student department of mechanical engineering and science school of engineering tokyo tech i was swimming in high school and i wanted to study sports at university i found sports engineering in the tokyo tech pamphlet and now i am studying here with professor nakashima i am not participating in any sports now but i continue working out my research theme is a simulation of canadian canoe paddling after completing the master s program i really want to be involved in the tokyo olympics he helps each student through weekly individual meetings affiliation of students registered before ay information on undergraduate and graduate schools of students registered from ay onwards is here published january
life as a researcher tokyo tech faculty interview what thoughts occupy the minds of pioneering researchers what attracts them to their field of study what drives them forward institute for liberal arts professor masashi shirabe spoke to four up and coming tokyo tech researchers about their work and their advice to students considering a career in research shirabe hello everyone thank you for joining me today i am sure that high school students especially those preparing for their university entrance examinations and undergraduate students thinking about graduate school would love to hear what goes through your mind as you work on cutting edge research topics could you first tell us about your areas of study hatano i moved to tokyo tech from a company in because i wanted to make a societal impact with my research on fundamental physical phenomena specifically i am working on the development of devices that control power conversion utilizing the unique physical properties of diamonds and biological sensors with applications in healthcare yamaguchi i am a graduate of the first cohort of tokyo tech s th academic group currently i am engaged in truly fundamental research on the mechanisms of gene expression and control i have immersed myself in this field since i joined the lab in my th year of the bachelor s degree program in addition to this i am also involved in clarifying the mechanisms of the effects of drugs and other applied research in drug discovery so i can say that my childhood dream of doing work of an altruistic nature has become a reality mutsuko hatano professor school of engineering yuki yamaguchi professor school of life science and technology vacha a central research topic in my lab is the clarification of properties and processes in organic and polymeric materials at the nanoscale level among these i focus on organic semiconductor materials used in solar cells and organic electroluminescent materials by utilizing a special method called single molecule spectroscopy which analyzes the light emitted by individual molecules we can clarify structures and characteristics at the nanoscale level jinnouchi as a member of the japanese group of the atlas experiment a project involving the combined efforts of particle physicists around the world i am working to identify unknown particles using the large hadron collider lhc the world s most powerful particle accelerator located at the european organization for nuclear research cern in the lhc was used to confirm the existence the higgs boson an elementary particle predicted by peter higgs a physics nobel laureate my research focuses on attempting to identify supersymmetric particles derived from the theory of supersymmetry martin vacha professor school of materials science and engineering osamu jinnouchi associate professor school of science freedom and the chance to be the first to discover something new shirabe what is it about your research that gives you the greatest satisfaction jinnouchi if we can find the supersymmetric particles we are looking for we will have defied conventional wisdom that would mean completely rewriting the physics textbooks there is no challenge more exciting than that vacha my motivation is very similar it is exhilarating to have the opportunity to confirm the properties of materials that have not been discovered yet most of this kind of work can only be achieved through research at universities the process is by no means easy and obstacles abound however experiencing the joys of discovery and sharing them with my students through teaching is a real pleasure yamaguchi of course it is very satisfying for a researcher to be the first to discover something new for myself one of the major attractions of research at university is the freedom to pursue our interests wherever they may lead while focusing on one topic for example we sometimes discover something altogether different quite unexpectedly which then leads to even more interesting directions in research such flexible shifts in research topics are possible at university while the goal oriented research at companies usually requires one to stick with a single line of inquiry this is one great advantage of conducting research at a university hatano i came here from an industrial research institute and i fully agree the freedom at university allows you to see where the research leads you rather than having to follow one specific pre determined route because of this consequences can rapidly change and it is often at these times of change that discoveries are made we can act according to these consequences and work with specialists in other fields when we see fit a university researcher putting together a study is like a conductor compiling an orchestral performance and let me tell you it is not nearly as stressful as research at a company shirabe i don t think research at universities is that easy either laugh hatano of course we encounter a wide range of difficulties in a university setting as well however because we exercise control over our own decisions there is less stress as professors vacha and jinnouchi pointed out we have the chance to be the first to discover something new regardless of whether the world reacts we know that we own that discovery laugh fundamental and applied research are equally exciting what research is useful shirabe generally when people think about research in the field of science and technology they think about applied research directly connected to commercialization research that leads to concrete answers applied research seems to be more popular than fundamental research among students too however after hearing professor ohsumi emphasize the importance of following your own interests in fundamental research at his nobel prize press conference i think more people realized the value of such research even though it may not lead to immediate conclusions what do you think hatano i agree and i think it is great industry does not always expect universities to carry out applied research that leads to commercialization they also greatly value fundamental research which is not easily executed under corporate research structures vacha i often hear students saying that they are interested in research that will be immediately useful to society some th year students in my lab have said that they want their research to have an impact after one year but that kind of goal is unrealistic hatano as a company researcher i worked for many years on research that was seen as useful however very little of that work actually led directly to commercialization vacha yes i really want students to understand the joy of doing fundamental research yamaguchi i think students can easily understand the meaning of research if they see its direct application in society i was like that too until i understood the true meaning of research i tended to concentrate on applied research because it was easier for me to see its connection to the real world although fundamental research is not as clear in this sense it gives you the feeling that you are finding answers to puzzles that no one has ever tried vacha you will not know the joy until you try yamaguchi that is why joining my research group is a two step process i try to attract students with applied research that is easy for them to understand and then invite them to experience the joy of fundamental research after they have joined shirabe interesting how do students choose the topic of their graduate thesis do more people lean towards applied research yamaguchi not at all once they experience both fundamental and applied research they realize that fundamental and applied research are equally exciting hatano i agree i feel that there is no real need to separate academic research into fundamental and applied jinnouchi i feel the same way fundamental and applied research are not separate quite the contrary they are always somehow connected that is another one of the joys of research what should we do to be more competitive shirabe i feel that tokyo tech has created an excellent environment for researchers but global competition in the field of science and technology is fierce we cannot afford to rest on our laurels can you share your views on how we can be more competitive hatano it is essential to promote cross disciplinary interactions something that tokyo tech set as a major focus in its research enhancements in my research on biological sensors would benefit greatly from collaborative work with medical specialists and researchers specializing in proteins at other universities it is very difficult today to create new value without integrating research fields in this sense i feel that tokyo tech s research enhancement efforts are very significant and that this issue requires a nationwide effort if we are to be more competitive globally vacha i think it is necessary to reform the doctoral program system in japan the country needs to improve financial support for researchers with doctoral degrees if the system more closely resembled that of the united states or europe where researchers are paid a salary to work on individual projects the number of outstanding students leaving university after a master s degree would decrease this would boost the research capabilities of tokyo tech too shirabe do you think students feel that aiming for a doctoral degree puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a job jinnouchi perhaps some do but it is far from true many doctoral program graduates are working actively at private companies yamaguchi that is particularly the case in the field of chemistry where employment opportunities are vast vacha most graduates join private companies while some remain in academia in fact while the number of postdoctoral researchers has been decreasing in the united states and europe due to budget cuts the number has remained stable in japan hatano my previous corporate employer hired many researchers with doctorates with the broad perspectives in a variety of fields you bring to the table you are highly valued wherever you go jinnouchi i have heard researchers at private companies saying the same thing they believe that individuals with doctorates are highly regarded in terms of both theoretical thought and project management hatano on the global stage researchers with doctorates are very common i suspect that japanese companies will increasingly require such researchers in the future ultimately you determine your future direction shirabe finally i would like to ask if you have a message for young students who would like to become researchers in the field of science and technology hatano researchers these days are less sure about what to investigate they are expected not only to identify topics but also create new value and design future society in order to realize such dynamic research it is essential to cooperate with other researchers specializing in different fields that is why tokyo tech created the institute of innovative research iir a structure that will undoubtedly revitalize research activities and greatly benefit students who decide to become researchers faculty members also utilize this research environment to push the limits of individual students we all hope to have many outstanding students joining us here at tokyo tech yamaguchi i have experience counseling high school students about their future careers and i noticed that many of them did not know if they wanted to join the th academic group at tokyo tech or the faculty of medicine or pharmacy at another university they really want to be engaged in life science research but it is easier to visualize their future path if they choose medicine or pharmacology a choice that also appeals to parents and teachers many students simply do not know which is best for them of course it is important to discuss this with their families and teachers however my message to students is that ultimately it is you who determines your future direction any direction you choose has its challenges whatever you do do it with all your effort i want young students to find what they really want to do and open the door to their future fundamental research applied research collaborative research all of this is possible at tokyo tech a diverse environment that responds to every student s needs and expectations vacha true interest is the best motivator for any researcher it is important for individual students to first find what truly interests them after entering university it is also important for students to discover their own unique research topic if they can do this the doors to the future will open up university provides an open environment where one can fully pursue research that nobody else has ever worked on there is nothing more exciting than that our graduates often say that although they find research at a company motivating the tokyo tech environment was unparalleled in terms of the pure pleasure of research jinnouchi the other day my research group had a reunion for the first time in years all my classmates who joined companies after acquiring their master s degrees said that the two year master s program at tokyo tech was the best time of their lives it is an unforgettable memory a special chapter of youth in their book of life when they could wholeheartedly focus on their research shirabe so that means that those of us who stayed to carry out research at university are still in our youth right jinnouchi yes of course laugh for the past years science and technology has progressed at an extraordinary pace and breakthroughs are made every year while global competition among researchers continues to intensify studying and conducting research at tokyo tech means being involved in truly cutting edge research activities we hope many young students with big dreams enter tokyo tech shirabe thank you for your time everyone interdisciplinary graduate majors tokyo tech s interdisciplinary graduate majors span multiple schools and

pok mon go meets tsubame while being highly regarded for his work on the development of the pok mon go application tatsuo nomura also did important work on supercomputers as a tokyo tech graduate student under professor satoshi matsuoka nomura and his former supervisor matsuoka met at the ookayama campus in late july just before the start up of tsubame one of the leading supercomputers in japan as colleagues who share the same passions they reminisced about the time they spent together talking about games supercomputers and overseas challenges from nagano to tokyo tech to study supercomputers under matsuoka nomura i haven t been to tokyo tech in a while it s a pleasure to see you again matsuoka it is great to see you too you were an undergraduate student at shinshu university when we met for the first time nomura yes i was thinking about leaving nagano my hometown to enter a university in tokyo to study supercomputers i was checking out universities and professors around the city and i learned about the work you were doing at the matsuoka lab i called immediately to make an appointment with you matsuoka what was your first impression of my research setup nomura it impressed me greatly when i saw the huge cluster of computers you had in operation i thought to myself this is where i want to do research matsuoka that must be the cluster system we set up for basic research on tsubame nomura yes i had never seen such an extensive system i was fascinated matsuoka as soon as i met you i saw a diligent hardworking man but i also realized that you had a special gift that set you apart from the rest nomura i am humbled by your words before i entered graduate school you invited me to a conference on supercomputers in hokkaido matsuoka yes that s right i assume the topics being discussed were fairly difficult for undergraduates nomura they were i didn t understand what everyone was talking about but nevertheless i was very excited at the thought that i would be learning about these things in graduate school matsuoka i remember you being interested in a study carried out by then assistant professor naoya maruyama currently a research fellow at the lawrence livermore national laboratory maruyama was working on domain specific languages dsl program languages tailored for specific science and technology domains that were very advanced at the time you made many research proposals under maruyama s supervision and your thesis was accepted by a world class journal that was well known for its strict standards i was very proud of you nomura i started learning about supercomputers after i entered graduate school without the strong support i received from you and dr maruyama i would not have succeeded taking the lead in pok mon go development at google matsuoka there are many talented students at tokyo tech if we can help guide them in the appropriate direction they often reach a world class level of research very quickly you chose an internship at google japan nomura a person that i admired greatly was at google japan i was very interested in the company because it attracted so many talented people matsuoka many students who studied under me in the master s program after you were accepted to internships at overseas companies you may have been the pioneer nomura i remember it was a three month internship and you and others at the matsuoka lab provided great support while i was there it was a very meaningful experience for me because it helped me find what i wanted to do with my future matsuoka corporate projects focus on the development of outstanding products which can then be commercialized research at universities is often more long term and focuses on innovative findings these are very different goals have you experienced such a difference between university and corporate culture nomura well google is a company so i received a salary but i can say that i was always working on something that truly interested me the atmosphere of the workplace was in fact very much like the lab i developed a strong desire to work at google because it offered me the opportunity to collaborate with talented engineers on exciting projects matsuoka yes but i never imagined that you would enter the field of game development nomura it was a surprise for me too the research i carried out at graduate school was not related to games at all what i was interested in at google was a map information project in fact i was working on google maps for a while then when i least expected it the opportunity to work on the pok mon go project came up i had loved pok mon since i was a child so you know i couldn t resist it matsuoka you are famous in japan as the man behind pok mon go although individuals are often honored for their work in the world of research it is quite rare in the private sector every time i came across the name nomura i always assumed you were still involved in academic research when i think about people who have been recognized in the game industry i remember the late satoru iwata a graduate of tokyo tech who went on to become the president of nintendo co ltd i was developing games with iwata when i was a college student after that i moved on to research on supercomputers and iwata went on to lead a corporation that is now respected by gamers throughout the world highlighting individuals in the industry encourages the younger generation and it was a wonderful surprise to learn that one of my students had been recognized for developing the pok mon game it is all connected in a strange but pleasant way niantic inc pok mon nintendo creatures inc game freak inc scaling out a concept common to supercomputers and clouds matsuoka i think pok mon go s success resulted not only from the great concept itself but also from the incorporated scalability that could respond to the increase in users and throughput it generated an explosive following but did not cause server failures the skills you developed through research on supercomputers and at your time at google really shine through in the scalability of pok mon go nomura you are right about the scalability actually though many other engineers were involved in the pok mon go project these engineers had experience working on other google projects of a similar scale before so they were very conscious of the importance of scalability while a separate server is usually allocated for about ten thousand online game users hundreds of millions of pok mon go players can play in the same world the server is logically the same but not physically although it hasn t gotten much press the technological innovativeness that went into pok mon go is well beyond existing games we discussed at length the scaling pok mon go on the google cloud platform and we are quite proud of this leading edge technology matsuoka i think only google could have pulled off such smooth operation of the server even under such heavy use nomura of course we had problems during development but these problems were all scalability related which we anticipated during the design stages so they were really not too difficult to address matsuoka cloud scalability is also related to supercomputers in the past improving the performance of a supercomputer involved improving performance of a single processor however a modern supercomputer uses a tremendous number of processors according to the purpose or workload to increase processing speed for example scientific simulations require hundreds of thousands of cpus working in concert the basic concept of the cloud system is the same although the purpose is different basically pok mon go and similar games employ supercomputers on a cloud with millions of cpus working simultaneously nomura this is something i knew absolutely nothing about before i began studying at your lab i learned the basic concept of scaling up to increase cpu processing capability and scaling out to increase processing speed by aggregating cpus google has expanded its business by taking advantage of this scaling out concept there is a direct link between my studies at graduate school and my current work matsuoka i think current supercomputers including tsubame and the cloud technology applied by google will improve based on this scaling out for at least the next years people s interest will shift more and more from supercomputer research to cloud services just as yours did nomura tsubame continues to improve i heard that tsubame will be in service from august of this year matsuoka yes the tsubame big data supercomputer s capacity in terms of ai processing is the best in japan it also features an ultra energy saving design achieveding the number one global ranking for energy efficiency in supercomputers in june this is the third time tsubame has been recognized in this way and i am personally very happy about it being the green supercomputer talented globetrotting youngsters revitalizing japan matsuoka there are many students at tokyo tech with the potential to stand in the global spotlight do you have any advice for them nomura many students at tokyo tech lack confidence in their english abilities this is such a waste my english was not good when i was a graduate student so i made it a point to spend time with students from abroad i became friends not only with international students in your lab but also with students from abroad studying under other professors and at other universities it was fun for me to expand my circle of friends and improve my english by the time i started working i really had no problem with english matsuoka building relationships when you are young is very important the network you build will support you later japanese students tend to shy away from demonstrating their abilities students who study with me and go on to do internships at overseas it companies and national laboratories abroad are often very highly regarded among interns from the world s best universities their value and talent is highly distinguished therefore i always hope that students will take more pride in themselves and be more confident in their abilities nomura american students are good at expressing themselves with confidence i was however relatively confident from my school days matsuoka i believe that the success of talented young japanese people like yourself on the global stage will revitalize japan if someone becomes an innovation hero as you have the environment becomes more favorable for those who want to follow in your footsteps i would like to tell students that people are not recognized because of what they say they are cast in the spotlight because they do something very special students should be aware of this so that they can identify that special quality in themselves nomura thank you for your kind words however i know that my success was not because of talent alone it had a lot to do with good luck the relationships i developed with others and the spread of smartphones of course a major part of that good luck was having had the opportunity to study with you and my talented labmates matsuoka would you tell me what you would like to do from now nomura as a game director i continue placing a priority on the improvement of pok mon go to ensure player satisfaction honestly i do not have any time to think about my future at the moment however i am an engineer so i would like to be engaged in work where i utilize the power of technology to make the world a better and more enjoyable place matsuoka when i visit the us for conferences i am always reminded of the fact that you work in silicon valley unfortunately i haven t had the opportunity to come and meet you i would really like to make time to visit you at your company nomura if it is you anytime satoshi matsuoka as a junior high school student in the s when personal computers first hit the market satoshi matsuoka became enthralled with software design his interest continued to grow in graduate school in he became an associate professor in the department of mathematical and computing sciences at tokyo tech s graduate school of information science and engineering since matsuoka has been a professor at the tokyo tech global scientific information and computing center gsic in he received the sidney fernbach award the highest honor in the field of supercomputers the professor and his team are the masterminds behind tsubame the supercomputer at gsic satoshi matsuoka pok mon go

tokyo tech s suzukakedai campus on june materials and structures laboratory professor hideo hosono heads mces as its director hosono invented igzo tft an oxide semiconductor suitable for driving liquid crystal panels and organic electroluminescent displays and an iron based superconductor a discovery which has countered conventional wisdom mces was established in august to conduct research for the benefit of society through the creation of innovative materials using elements with high clarke numbers in other words those abundant in earth s crust exterior of the genso cube as its nickname suggests the genso cube has a cubical design and is fitted with special equipment for high precision experiments the building features a transmission electron microscope tem and an electron probe micro analyzer on the basement floor a lecture room seating people on the st floor joint research laboratories for companies and external research institutions on the nd floor and laboratories for tokyo tech researchers on the th th and th floors it is highly regarded as an open global research base by researchers both at home and abroad we want to conduct research that will defy conventional wisdom on elements hosono explains in order to do so the director has focused his efforts on achieving results that lead to industrialization creating new materials science trends and constructing an environment that facilitates the development of excellent researchers young researchers invited by hosono are also involved in projects here three of them were asked for their thoughts on element strategy research the genso cube and the development of research professionals creation based on unconventional concepts research at the genso cube strives for practical applications how do you emphasize this in your research satoru matsuishi research fields inorganic materials physical properties applied physical properties profile matsuishi i have been involved in the creation of electride compounds for ten years i also conduct research on iron based superconducting substances and am currently looking at hydrogen using hydrogen as a negative ion in materials can improve superconducting performance and add new functions as for practical applications we are prone to think of joint research with companies however i am dealing with a broader concept i am applying unconventional concepts to create new substances that benefit the betterment of society in general for instance in terms of energy issues cement an oxide composed of calcium silicon and aluminum is a good example it has been thought that oxides composed of typical elements whose atomic numbers are low do not allow electricity to pass through them however looking at the crystal structure of cement it should conduct electricity regardless of its constitutional elements this concept allows us to discover new electrides tada my role is to search for new materials using computer simulations discover new functions and create new concepts that allow us to clarify phenomena which at first glance look complicated in the search for electrorides we make use of a materials database based on electronics structure calculations to find the composition ratios and structures of positive and negative ions for electrides in this way we can identify potential candidates for electrides in terms of energetical stability transmission electron microscope station in the genso cube although computational simulations are executable even for hypothetical compounds researchers and companies engaged in materials synthesis and catalytic applications with the goal of commercialization insist on cost effectiveness and environmental consciousness it was tough at first to adjust and design our calculations from this viewpoint because i did not have ideas regarding the requirements that experimental researchers consider of the highest importance however as i experienced many difficulties in true materials designing that cannot be acquired through computer simulations only i realized the importance of adopting a broader perspective kitano i am mainly involved in researching whether the electrides mentioned by dr matsuishi can be developed and applied to catalytic reactions while social need is important i have realized upon looking back on my discovery of potential ammonia synthesis using an electride with greater performance than that of conventional catalysts that we should look beyond merely satisfying a need a major method for synthesizing ammonia the haber bosch process was established years ago and researchers involved in the development of catalysts have not seen a need to replace it with other methods we presented a completely different concept for ammonia synthesis using an electride catalyst many companies asked us to expand the use of this method for other applications rather than just using it as a replacement synthesis method through this i realized that involvement in new materials and catalysts and the dissemination of such information can create new needs in the case of joint development companies sometimes tell us that methods reported in academic papers may not be applicable in commercialization therefore flexible thinking is required bringing in ideas from researchers in different fields what kind of thinking is required to achieve effective breakthroughs in materials science research and to create new trends masaaki kitano research fields catalysts resource chemical processes profile kitano researchers tend to focus on their own specializations but we also get information from people in different fields an example of this is dr tada s simulations suggesting the possibility of producing new materials conversations with dr matsuishi often spark completely new ideas and perspectives on data that previously looked mediocre to me i carry high hopes that this interaction will lead to significant breakthroughs in the future when we use electrides as catalytic material for example we immobilize metal nano particle catalysts on the surface metal nano particles are immobilized in a dispersed state with a general method used by researchers engaged in catalyst research however the electride catalyst prepared by this method did not perform at all as expected if i had been the only one involved in the research i would have concluded that the electride could not be used as a catalyst however by using a scanning tunneling microscope stm and other devices the hosono group had already clarified that the maintenance or destruction of the electride surface structure cage like structure significantly affects electrical conduction characteristics this helped us to discover that immobilizing metal nano particles without destroying the surface structure significantly improves catalytic performance the group consists of researchers specializing in a wide range of fields i believe that listening carefully to their ideas and applying them to our research will spark new ideas matsuishi researchers specializing in different fields have different ways of thinking for example researchers looking at catalytic reactions handle agents which we generally think are dangerous without any problems computational models of physical properties which i personally think are difficult may not be a problem for researchers who are familiar with the proper models before we collaborate with companies it is important for us to collaborate with other researchers at tokyo tech thin film synthesis and characterization equipment tada materials are of course directly connected to our daily lives taking advantage of new materials for home appliances and clothing can change our lifestyle drastically in addition to the motivation to discover new materials collaboration with other researchers can free us from our own limiting thoughts leading to a broadened viewpoint and new directions in the search for materials and in turn providing strength in our search for a breakthrough attractive research naturally develops researchers what do you think about developing young researchers as leaders and the stimulus you get at mces tomofumi tada research fields quantum chemistry electronic structure theory computational materials designa profile tada professor hosono is a strong distinguished leader from his leadership i recognized that when many researchers having similar or different viewpoints are engaged in a project as a team it is necessary to find areas of focus and create a big flow that absolutely leads to a successful goal in addition it is also necessary to maintain a positive motivation to continue the same research the strong support by professor hosono also helps us to keep this motivation i therefore need to find my own ways of advancing my research and maintaining a motivating environment for younger researchers this is essential in encouraging the next generation kitano what i have learned from my experience is that everyone should struggle with adversity i want to emphasize this to my students when i was engaged in joint research with professor hosono as an assistant professor i was becoming desperate working on a project for one month without any results the professor was stern that can t be right keep working and you will succeed he said this changed my attitude and helped me to continue and three months later i achieved results if we engage in enjoyable and attractive research we improve ourselves naturally the director often reminds us of this following my research interests has made me what i am i will pass this down to the next generation what has changed after your move to genso cube night view of the genso cube matsuishi opportunities for exchanging ideas with researchers beyond the boundaries of individual fields have increased significantly when students working with superconductive materials measure physical properties they often use existing measuring devices rather than creating their own on the other hand in the research on catalysts that dr kitano is involved in they start by processing the glass and metal they will be working with it is a great environment for both researchers and students to see the process of development from the beginning in neighboring laboratories tada in this new building students in our laboratory enjoy their research life in the student room of the hosono laboratory allowing them to come into contact with hot information and topics it is an excellent environment for young theoretical researchers and students although the amount of information they obtain may sometimes be overwhelming it is definitely a great experience for their development in the long run materials are the key to fundamental breakthroughs in science and technology the public have great expectations for mces what do you think mces should be kitano the hosono group has achieved many innovative results in materials research therefore the public is always looking forward to their next innovation i also feel the pressure of such expectations however it is natural for people to have great expectations for our research as what we are doing is discovering new methods in the field of science i appreciate having such an excellent environment to conduct research in my hope and aspiration is the creation of new catalyst materials based on original concepts tada materials informatics a state of the art approach in computational materials exploration has attracted much attention around the world mces is required to show a successful strategy of computational materials science for the discovery of new materials the genso cube exhibits an excellent function that allows us to carefully analyze the simulation results by comparing them with experimental data by other researchers everyone can share the progress and results of their research at the genso cube at any time multi floor stairwell inside the genso cube matsuishi the number of laboratories that deal with substance synthesis has been decreasing in every country some experiments carry life threatening risks if we make mistakes however we do not shrink away from such risks instead we do our best to ensure safety by simulating experiments and we continue working toward our goal of creating new materials i have synthesized new materials however i often doubted their usefulness although i was involved in the synthesis of electrides i could not connect their application to ammonia synthesis however i also realize that attempting to synthesize materials with the aim of producing something useful alone is not enough to make a scientific discovery it is always essential to think about development and use together this is materials development that truly considers function new materials are those that lead to fundamental breakthroughs in a wide range of scientific fields the genso cube has the human resources and facilities needed to produce such new materials present and future of materials development hideo hosono founding director materials research center for element strategy mces ever expanding possibility of a small rock japan is strong in material development and still at the world s top level however no one can guarantee that japan will be in the current position after three years there are few researchers who are seeking new materials from their heart many people think that there is little room for expansion but this is not true if you take a careful look underneath you can find a lot of undiscovered materials the field of materials is fertile for such discovery working together under one roof people inspire people we are not inspired only by others research papers we are inspired by our five senses it is extremely important for us to feel that we will be able to achieve people are not improved by others people who are capable of being improved improve the most important thing in the drive to improve ourselves is to find opportunities and environments where we are inspired by others the genso cube is excellent in this sense because all of us here have similar spirit and ambition extracted from the keynote lecture at mces opening ceremony on june explanations of technical terms clarke american geochemistry pioneer frank wigglesworth clarke first examined the chemical composition of rocks in earth s crust russian geologist a e fersman continued the study of elements in the crust and proposed that the numbers used to represent the quantities of elements be named clarkes to honor the american elements with high clarke numbers are abundant while those with low ones are rare electride compounds compounds in which electrons serve as anions the first room temperature stable electride was realized using an alumina cement ingredient cao al o c a utilizing the characteristics of chemical inertness and thermal stability of the c a electride and electrons that emit easily it is applied to high functional catalysts and electronic materials and has the potential of being capable of solving food and energy issues and contributing broadly to a highly information based society haber

creating artificial bones for faster bone regeneration artificial bones that replace and regenerate lost bones the human body is capable of healing fractured bones by rejoining them allowing injured immobilized individuals to become mobile again this is due to our cortical bones regenerative capability bone regeneration is made possible by the interaction between two kinds of cells osteoblast and osteoclast osteoclast is a giant cell with a diameter of about m and it independently absorbs destroys old bones osteoblast on the other hand is a small cell with a diameter of about m and it forms new bones by working with many other cells bones are always regenerating through a perpetual cycle of bone resorption and bone formation however if a bone is lost or damaged due to a disease or an injury it is difficult for the body to regenerate it demand for artificial bone has increased in japan in recent years as a solution to this problem professor junzo tanaka is a leading researcher who has been devoting himself to the development of artificial bone materials for more than twenty years bones are much stronger than people think a bone about the size of a sugar cube can sustain the weight of ten kg sumo wrestlers however strength alone is not sufficient for artificial bones to fully integrate with our own bones new material made by mixing hydroxyapatite with collagen artificial bone was originally designed as a prosthetic material serving as an alternative to autogenous bone graft material which put an enormous burden on patients artificial bone was initially made of metals and solid ceramics for strength but the rigidity of the materials made it difficult for artificial bone to blend into bone tissues and it could not be used for children for a long period of time in the s demand for artificial bone skyrocketed due to the development of artificial bones made of hydroxyapatite hydroxylated calcium phosphate a material similar to natural bone and those made of tricalcium phosphate a material that can be resorbed and replaced by natural tissue however these materials were still too rigid to be processed and adjusted for transplants although various forms of materials were developed such as solid blocks powder and pumice like materials problems persisted as these materials were difficult to be used in surgical procedures and sometimes got completely absorbed after transplant without leading to bone regeneration in promising research results turned the situation around the research was conducted by professor tanaka head of the biomaterials center of national institute for materials science nims at the time dr masanori kikuchi researcher at the time currently the center s group leader and a research group at tokyo medical and dental university they were successful in developing a fibrous material made by mixing hydroxyapatite and biomaterial collagen the resulting material had elasticity that existing artificial bones did not have animal testing has already been completed and the safety of the material has been confirmed two types of extracellular matrix organic collagen and inorganic apatite form the layered structure of bones specifically bone tissue is formed through the secretion of collagen by osteoblasts and the deposition of hydroxyapatite on the surface of bones the newly developed artificial bone had the composition and structure that were nearly identical to those of natural bone professor tanaka a chemical bond is formed between collagen and apatite in other words between organic and inorganic components of bone the size of hydroxyapatite crystals is nm and the size of collagen molecules is nm the nano level alignment of hydroxyapatite along collagen fibers allows a single material to have tensile and compressive strengths similar to those of natural bone by taking advantage of the characteristics of the two components we were able to create a material that is functionally identical to natural bone that bone cells can easy adhere to with this the technology of bone regenerative medicine finally advanced a rookie who was assigned the task of developing artificial bone hoya technosurgical corporation daisuke shoji left takehiko nakajima right at a seminar on the new artificial bone material developed by professor tanaka one company showed immediate interest in the material it was pentax corporation now known as hoya technosurgical corporation a leading company in ceramic artificial bone mr takehiko nakajima director senior manager r d department hoya technosurgical corporation who attended the seminar looks back on that time and says i was working as a sub section chief when i heard about the material i immediately knew that we would be involved in its development and commercialization although composites using polylactic acid and other polymers were being studied using a composite of collagen and apatite made sense to me because they are naturally found in the human body as mr nakajima expected the company announced that it will develop new artificial bone then in the project began as part of the commissioned development program of japan science and technology corporation jst to everyone s surprise the project was assigned to a new employee mr daisuke shoji currently team leader marketing knowledge management section hoya technosurgical corporation who had just joined the company mr nakajima as soon as the project started mr shoji s name came to my mind as the most suitable person to be in charge of it since the company had never dealt with collagen before we needed someone with a flexible mind who was not bound by convention in this respect a new employee such as mr shoji was appropriate to lead the project mr shoji who had dreamed of becoming an engineer since he was in middle school entered nagaoka university of technology and studied in the department of materials science and technology after graduating from a technical college unlike his peers who all took interest in the features of materials and end products he was interested in the manufacturing process perhaps his appreciation for craftsmanship made him the most qualified candidate for leading the project which required persistence mr shoji i was determined to do my best as a rookie i still clearly remember that rather than feeling anxious i could not have been happier as a researcher that i could be involved in a project to develop a promising new material for artificial bone to prepare for the project mr shoji was sent to the tanaka laboratory at nims for one year to learn the necessary techniques for developing artificial bone the following ten years despite the challenges of storing and conducting experiments on an organic material such as collagen which decomposes at high temperature unlike inorganic ceramics mr shoji embarked on the development of artificial bone immediately upon his return to the company the greatest challenge was deciding on the structure of the artificial bone after careful consideration and listening to the voices of medical professionals the team settled for a sponge like structure which provided elasticity and ease of cutting in order to make high density and uniform pores for bone cells to pass through they incorporated a technique for creating fine ice crystals or making ice cream mr shoji if the pores of a porous medium are too large elasticity decreases if the pores are too small elasticity increases but it becomes more difficult for cells and blood vessels to enter the pores therefore the first point to consider was the size of the pores in addition clinical doctors required the material to have a certain level of elasticity in order to address both of these issues proper pore size and porosity had to be determined we tried various methods primarily focusing on methods used in food processing including ice crystallization and repeated animal testing in our best efforts to solve these problems a certain level of effectiveness was confirmed with animal testing and the problems of pore size and porosity had been solved but immediately before the start of the clinical trial the team faced a new problem a revision of the pharmaceutical affairs law although some raised their voices to terminate the project the enthusiasm of management mr nakajima mr shoji and other employees kept the project going after overcoming many difficulties the first artificial bone using collagen refit was born in the project took years to complete looking back on the years of fighting an uphill battle mr nakajima and mr shoji remarked as follows those ten years went by quickly using the regenerative capacity of fish scales to help the elderly professor tanaka who has contributed greatly to the development of the field of bone regenerative medicine through various research is now engaged in the study of a promising material with his laboratory colleague associate professor toshiyuki ikoma the material they are researching is fish scales in particular scales of tilapia which mainly inhabit fresh and brackish waters in subtropical and tropical zones associate professor ikoma we were looking for a way to recycle fish scales that get disposed of around seacoasts that s how our research started fish scales are not easily decomposed and there are those from around years ago that still remain today we first looked at the collagen of sea bream scales through an electron microscope and found that it is very dense however since the collagen denaturation temperature of sea bream scales is around and we needed something with a higher denaturation temperature we looked into the tropical regions and came upon tilapia not all fish scales are viable candidates the essential requirement is for the denaturation temperature of collagen to be close to or above the human body temperature collagen extracted from fishes living in low temperature water such as salmon and cod transforms into gelatin due to its low denaturation temperatures collagen of fish scales has a strong tendency to restore to the in vivo state in a process called fiberization and it has been discovered that cells proliferate well on fiberized collagen stimulating cell differentiation furthermore cells stick to fish scale collagen much stronger than they do to pig collagen in an experiment jointly conducted with hokkaido university s school of medicine they observed that transplanting high intensity artificial bone using fish scale collagen into rabbits regenerated their bones in three months compared to six months using pig collagen in other words the regeneration speed was twice as fast using fish scale collagen professor tanaka if we can speed up the process of bone regeneration i believe we would be able to contribute to medical care for the elderly who have diminished osteoblast activity i can t say for sure but i believe there will come a day when we can treat diseases such as osteoporosis that many elderly people suffer from associate professor ikoma followed up with a comment on further possibilities as you may know fish are able to regenerate lost scales this means that if we can uncover the regeneration mechanism of fish scale it may also become possible to make materials such as organs and the corneal stroma using fish cells we are currently collaborating with researchers in the fields of medicine and biology from various universities to uncover this mechanism fish scales may become a part of our eyes and bones they may even be used to regenerate organs but one thing is for certain organic inorganic composite materials will pave the way for regenerative medicine autogenous bone refers to a patient s own bone ilium and ribs are often used for autogenous bone grafting the research results used by hoya technosurgical inc for their product development were obtained by professor tanaka during his career at nims as part of japan science and technology s core research for evolutional science and technology collagen denaturation temperature is the temperature at which triple helical structure of collagen becomes loose and

ai powered sensing technology to watch over the earth and connect to the future kentaro matsuura sony group corporation sony semiconductor solutions corporation visiting faculty hokkaido university doctor of engineering wheat growth sensing in hokkaido a challenge for sustainable agriculture news of extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts and floods continues to unfold as climate change progresses and threatens the earth and our lives on it mr matsuura who works for sony group corporation is tackling global challenges through the use of ai and sensing technologies as part of this effort he is pursuing research on wheat growth sensing in hokkaido looking back on his student days when he was immersed in device research and forward to the present he talked about his studies and experiences that are utilized in his daily work attracted by the limitless possibilities of devices i began researching transistors using new materials in high school i actively studied science subjects to put this knowledge to use i enrolled in the department of electrical and electronic engineering at tokyo institute of technology th academic group in while studying a wide range of topics such as information and control systems i was most interested in the class on device systems devices such as smartphones and pcs are now an integral part of our lives intrigued by this real world impact i applied to the hitoshi wakabayashi laboratory which specializes in device research thereafter i kept my research in this laboratory until the completion of my doctoral program prof wakabayashi has been very helpful to me not only in my research but also in various aspects of my student life he is a mentor in my life that i still keep in touch with what i was researching at the time was the development of transistors using new materials transistors are an important component of electronic devices that serve two functions as a switch that conducts current and as an amplifier that adjusts the magnitude of the current with many smaller transistors electronic devices can implement more sophisticated functions therefore to contribute to making even smaller transistors i began research on transistors using a new material called molybdenum disulfide in the transistor fabrication process a uniform thin film of molybdenum disulfide is formed on the wafer substrate and metal and insulating materials are placed on top it took about two days to produce the transistor but the finished transistor did not work as expected and we continued to struggle with it i will never forget the moment when we finally confirmed that the transistor worked after many prototypes we were delighted because this was the first time that a transistor made from molybdenum disulfide had been successfully fabricated in the wakabayashi laboratory a passion for manufacturing that was fostered through these successful experiences has become the core of who i am today from creating to utilizing technology promoting sustainable smart agriculture in order to move on to an environment where i could broaden my possibilities i looked at multiple industries during my job search without being constrained by the topics of my research as a student it was during this time that i came across the sony group corporation with its diverse businesses centered on manufacturing and technology after my student days when i was immersed in manufacturing i wanted to contribute to the utilization of that technology at work and i am now involved in a wide range of work tasks i am mainly in charge of a project called the earth mimamori platform this was initiated to protect the earth from natural disasters that are becoming more frequent due to global warming using sensing technology sensors equipped with ai processing are deployed around the world and the observation data is analyzed by ai to visualize changes in the global environment through these efforts we aim to pursue economic rationality as a company along with social value such as disaster prevention and promotion of people s behavioral changes during my first two years with the company i worked on the development of ai for sensing devices using our spresense tm iot board computer i have conducted a series of verifications to develop an ai that works even with small iot boards in addition i focused on activities to promote these technologies outside the company such as at overseas hackathon events the demonstration test is being conducted in a wheat field on the hokkaido university campus with professor noboru noguchi left of the research faculty of agriculture hokkaido university the apparatus in mr matsuura s on the right hand contains the eltres communication device in my third year i was transferred to hokkaido where i am conducting joint research with hokkaido university as part of the earth mimamori platform project one of these research projects is a wheat growth sensing demonstration test that we are conducting with professor noboru noguchi of the university s research faculty of agriculture wheat is an essential source of calories for us for its cultivation it is very important to gauge how the ears are growing and apply pesticides at the right time but it takes a lot of time and effort for farmers to watch over around the vast wheat fields so we thought that we could use ai and sensing technology to solve the problem first the imx tm image sensor with ai processing was installed on the farmland to observe the number of wheat ears the amount of moisture in the soil and the temperature the collected data is then sent to a satellite via a wireless communication standard called eltres tm farmers can then receive data from the satellite and determine when to apply pesticides without having to go to the field eltres is also well suited for farmland that is nearly out of range because it can transmit data to distant locations with a small amount of electricity if this wheat growth sensing technology can be put into practice it will reduce the burden on farmers while maintaining the production quantity and quality bringing us one step closer to a sustainable society with an adventurous spirit and a passion for manufacturing pass on to the next generation a livable planet the earth mimamori platform is a global effort to make our lives more sustainable some of the team members are from overseas and the international sensibility and leadership skills i developed at tokyo tech are proving useful as a student i was given the opportunity to go abroad on multiple occasions in addition to presenting at international conferences in the first year of my master s program i studied abroad at epfl the swiss federal institute of technology lausanne in the third year of my doctoral program i participated in an internship at the ibm thomas j watson research center in new york in addition at the academy for global leadership agl which i belonged to as a doctoral student i faced my inner self in a profound way through workshops this experience has been put to good use in my current position leading a joint research effort furthermore what has helped me to carve out a career is the adventurous spirit that was nurtured during my college years tokyo tech offers a wide variety of educational programs and support and i took advantage of them to study abroad and participate at the agl because i learned how wonderful it is to expand my horizons by jumping into a new world rather than staying in a familiar environment i am able to venture forward and advance my career in the real world in fact when i was approached about a transfer to hokkaido i accepted with a resounding yes i believe that my strength lies in the fact that i see changes in the environment as opportunities for growth the most significant thing i gained at tokyo tech was a firm commitment to manufacturing the desire to deliver new and better products to society has remained a driving force for me both during my student days when i was immersed in device development and now as i am involved in the social implementation of technology with my strengths in both creating and utilizing new technologies i hope to solve as many of the world s problems as possible with the power of manufacturing and pass it on to future generations matsuura s career path

designing a gut environment to achieve a zero disease society yoshinori mizuguchi metagen inc director cfo doctor of engineering taking on next generation health care based on his experience as a student entrepreneur researcher and exchange student although we hear the phrase regulate your gut environment in advertisements and other media on a daily basis it is still not widely known that personalized healthcare for the gut environment can actually help achieve a zero disease society in which everyone remains healthy based on the belief that craftsmanship can save people dr yoshinori mizuguchi who conducted research at tokyo tech and is currently the cfo of metagen is at the forefront of gut environment research at the company he looked back on his seven years of intense research as well as the dual challenge of starting his own business while he was a student he also talked about the invaluable experiences that have made him who he is today my own starting point was wanting to create something new and save patients with intractable diseases who have been left behind i decided that i wanted to contribute to the world through life science research when i read the book iyakuhin kuraisisu cho en shijo no gekishin pharmaceutical crisis the trillion yen market shock by kentaro sato while i was a student at a technical college the problem discussed in the book refers to a social issue the concern that patents for major pharmaceuticals would expire simultaneously around the period severely affecting the earnings of various pharmaceutical manufacturers i realized then for the first time that if profits were to fall it would make it even more difficult to fund the development of drugs for intractable diseases which are already technically difficult to create and patients with intractable diseases would be left behind it is not that i did not consider going into medicine from the perspective of treating sick people but since i have always loved making things i decided to help people by creating new things myself it was with the problem in mind that i took up the challenge of researching nucleic acid drugs early in my technical college stage which at the time were gradually attracting interest as a means for new drug discovery technology after graduating from a technical college in order to further deepen my research i transferred to the department of bioscience in the school of bioscience and biotechnology at the tokyo institute of technology that offer an engineering approach to the field of biology during my undergraduate studies i mainly studied bioinformatics which is the use of computers to analyze information held by biomolecules including genomes to improve related aspects of life and medicine from the fourth year of the bachelor s degree program i became a member of the eiry kobatake laboratory where i immersed myself in research to develop technologies that will lead to regenerative medicine the drugs available on the market are more about suppressing the symptoms of diseases and i was attracted to regenerative medicine because of its potential to cure the root cause of diseases during the master s and doctoral programs i raced towards the creation of an ideal society after graduating from the bachelor s degree program i entered the master s program at the graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology at tokyo tech and at the same time i joined the education academy of computational life sciences acls this was an initiative adopted by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext as a program for leading graduate schools i decided to enroll in the program because i felt it would help me realize my dreams as i would be able to study life science my specialty as well as informatics while interacting with students of the same grade and people from the industry and also receive an incentive grant a major turning point in my life was an industry internship as part of the acls program in when i was a first year master s student i participated with my acls colleagues in a business contest for which the company sponsoring the internship was calling for entries we came up with the idea of a smart toilet that would analyze personal health information from the gut bacteria found in stool but the result was unsuccessful the following year we were again unsuccessful in our re entry but through an introduction by the organizer we met dr shinji fukuda a researcher of the gut environment at the same time we started discussions with dr takuji yamada a faculty member of the same graduate school and an expert in bioinformatics after hitting it off with the professors i decided to enter the bioscience grand prix this time specializing in health care finally we were able to win the grand prix in the following month my acls colleagues and i also won the top prize in the edge innovation challenge competition an idea competition sponsored by the mext through these experiences i had stimulating discussions with like minded colleagues which led me to found metagen in march of the same year together with dr fukuda dr yamada and my classmates i was in the second year of the master s degree program and started my own business without much hesitation despite needing to balance it with schoolwork looking back i feel that i would have decided to start a business sooner or later because i had the feeling that unless researchers implement the results of their research in the real world themselves they would not be able to change society directly also after the various encounters i just couldn t resist the urge to test out my ideas then of course it was not a simple task especially when i was simultaneously engaged in three things doctoral research running a company and studying abroad a requirement but i made good use of my time and overcame the difficulties i chose the cancer science institute csi at the national university of singapore nus where the time difference from japan is relatively small i checked my work e mail during spare time when i was doing bio experiments such as electrophoresis in the lab and worked on my doctoral dissertation when traveling to meetings i was clueless about running a company but i steadily accumulated knowledge piece by piece studying on the fly i was the company s chief operating officer coo to oversee sales activities when the company was first established chief strategy officer cso to manage business strategy after completing my doctoral studies and chief financial officer cfo to handle finance since changing my role as the company grew other activities outside the company include taking part in the industrial structure council by the ministry of economy trade and industry in as a manager of a venture company and making proposals for policies to promote the success of young talent currently as a member of the committee on human resources of the mext i am taking part in discussions aimed at creating a society in which ph d holders can play a more active role controlling the gut environment the key to a healthy society and translating research results into real world implementation the metagen group has set its sights on a zero disease society as its ultimate goal through a two pronged approach metagen which provides health care based on the gut environment and metagen therapeutics which undertakes medical drug discovery projects to make progress toward this goal we are promoting real world implementation of research results on the gut environments the gut microbiota is the collection of bacteria in the gut the additional organ that greatly affects people s health improving the gut environment is an urgent issue but the gut environment is unique and dependent on dietary and lifestyle habits and requires an individualized approach therefore i believe that appropriate application of information on gut bacteria and metabolites in stool will be an important component in building the healthy society of the future in addition in order to return the fruit of research results to society a variety of stakeholders including food companies and material manufacturers must be involved we run the gut design project a community for corporate collaboration where companies that share the gut design philosophy are working together to create a new market in fact in april of this year in cooperation with calbee inc we were able to launch body granola a granola subscription service that allows individuals to select ingredients based on their own gut environment as we aim for a zero disease society we want to create a society where of people are healthy so it is a big step for us to be able to offer a product that lets individuals choose based on their gut environment with an eye on the future years from now we will continue to uncover insights with an insatiable spirit of inquiry and pass the baton to the next generation mizuguchi s career path while attending technical college learned about the problem advocating the danger of patients with intractable diseases being left behind and decided to help people through craftsmanship transferred to the bachelor s

i want to do things differently from other people and live creatively alexis andr researcher phd sony computer science laboratories inc fifteen years ago a young man from france left his hometown and came to the tokyo institute of technology hereinafter tokyo tech at our school he overcame difficulties and obtained his doctoral degree through the tokyo tech graduate program today he has started to provide the world with a series of results from unique research that is a blend of art and computer science learning of a stimulating research field through part time work about thirty researchers belong to the sony computer science laboratories hereinafter sony csl each of these researchers focuses on a unique research theme i first set foot in sony csl when i was in graduate school doctoral program at tokyo tech for my part time job i went to sony csl about twice per week in order to do programming as an assistant to researchers my supervisor was a researcher in advanced mathematics to be honest i had absolutely no idea what he was doing in his research in the adjacent office was none other than the neuroscientist kenichiro mogi it was an extremely stimulating environment which opened my eye to a wide range of research methods at that time i had hit a wall when writing my doctoral thesis however the stimulation that i received from my part time work enabled me to finish the thesis i decided to apply as a researcher at sony csl and was hired after completing my studies at graduate school using computers to create excitement and beauty a screenshot of alexis instagram posting on instagram is how i train my creativity while in graduate school at tokyo tech i conducted research on machine learning computer graphics interfaces and computer vision which utilizes the characteristics of human vision nevertheless upon starting work at sony csl i was told to conduct different research than what i did at university i had been waiting for such a challenge and i started by researching video games while in graduate school i had opened a seminar together with younger students who sought employment at video game companies after entering sony csl i decided to try making video games myself furthermore i had set my sights on intentionally creating kusoge poor quality games that were quirky and possessed unintentional humor a rare genre to be sure why do people find some kusoge to be so interesting to the point that they can t stop playing the positive aspects of sony csl are that the work itself is very interesting and originality is all that is required gradually my research progressed from mere gameplay to the pursuit of beauty art and aesthetics which incorporated the visual research that i had conducted at graduate school using computers to draw pictures had always been a hobby of mine my goal for is to post a new original animation on instagram every day no matter how tired or intoxicated i might be by committing myself to producing daily animation i hope to discover a wealth of new ideas and enhance my programming skills similar to how professional athletes improve through daily practice as my goal for the coming year i am considering switching to music production eventually i was placed in charge of art at sony csl i proposed a program for automatic generation of designs which perfectly match the individual characteristics of users the program was used to create logos for all researchers a difficult aspect of creating pictures and designs is selecting colors in order to reduce the work involved in color matching i created a program which automatically extracts color schemes from input photographs and then generates a color palette the result was the color palette extraction system omoiiro i had originally created omoiiro as a background program for increasing work efficiency however through my work i became acquainted with designers at issey miyake the designers were interested in my program and we collaborated in an interesting project using omoiiro to extract colors tones from snapshots taken in cities throughout the world the extracted colors tones were then used in handbag designs the computer automatically decides upon colors based on distinct image data and photographs filled with memories the results of this automatic processing fit wonderfully with human feeling this is an interesting and meaningful phenomenon today ai technology is spreading throughout society in addition to pictures and designs music has already been automatically generated in the future it will become possible to create films in which the story changes depending on the mood of the viewer on that day the imagination and ingenuity of children creates original playtime toio is a cube that breathes life into toys when used together with children s handicrafts lego creations action figures etc the toio project began from around and toio was commercialized by sony in toio is a toy platform which elicits the imagination and ingenuity of children automatically inducing playtime uninhibited imagination expands throughout the minds of young children and they conceive fantastic stories however during the process of growing up children gradually stop devising their own playtime scenarios instead they start using playtime scenarios commercially sold video games etc which are provided by other people there is the possibility that this change is a meaningful part of maturation however i want children to play with ingenuity and creativity instead of playing passively toio is not a simple toy rather it is a platform which expands the joy of playing with toys through the imagination and ideas of children with toio children combine a small cube shaped robot with their favorite toys and use a ring shaped controller through trial and error children use toio to create their own play although this cube shaped robot possesses unparalleled high performance for a robot of this size it is merely a supporting device the main actors are the child and their favorite toys used when playing with toio toio had to overcome various obstacles before it was released commercially however i was never discouraged since i had the experience of overcoming hardship when writing my doctoral thesis i was sure that everything would be fine reflecting both i now realize that experiencing setbacks at an early stage of my life was actually a blessing furthermore i believe that i made a great decision in coming to japan i met my wife who had been studying abroad in japan at that time and i became acquainted with many outstanding people through my work japan is a very livable country which presents a variety of opportunities moving forward i look forward to many more encounters with wonderful people i will live creatively while seeking my own original excitement and beauty alexis career path embarks from the grandes cole sup lec france to study abroad at tokyo tech majors in computer science in the master s program i came to japan when i was years old i still have fond memories of attending the coming of age ceremony held by the city of yokohama where the tokyo tech shofu dormitory was located i had no idea what was happening entered the doctoral program at the tokyo tech graduate school conducted research on computer graphics computer vision interfaces etc after completing the doctoral program entered employment at sony computer science laboratories through a collaboration with issey miyake involved in the release of handbags designed using the color pallet extraction system omoiiro it was around this time that i began to feel the thrill of having my ideas realized through encounters with other people color variation created using a photograph of a stained glass window from a church release of toio a toy platform for children by sony alexis was involved in conceptual proposals and development for toio i first thought of this concept when watching my own child playing alexis andr profile at the age of alexis skipped two grades and entered the sup lec cole sup rieure d lectricit which is one of the grandes coles specialized institutions of higher education in france he graduated the sup lec in with a major in energy and information science in he entered the department of computer science at the graduate school of information science and engineering tokyo institute of technology at tokyo tech he completed the master s program in and the doctoral program in in he entered sony computer science laboratories his current employer published october
interviews with graduates three graduating students were interviewed prior to the doctoral graduation ceremony for the academic year they spoke about their research and campus life at tokyo tech i will expand my horizons by building on my experience at tokyo tech what brought you to tokyo tech s graduate school professor asahi second from right and sato far right with lab members i chose tokyo tech for its doctoral degree program i had previously decided to continue my studies and considered the options offered by labs at various universities as i wanted to broaden my perspective what brought me to tokyo tech was the presentation given at a seminar by members of the asahi lab i was interested in their research visited the lab and met with professor koichi asahi i thought his lab was the place for me to take on new challenges in research what was your most memorable experience during your time at tokyo tech looking back on the days as a doctoral student what impresses me is that i had a free hand in conducting research in the asahi lab members use an active feedback nuclear spin maser a unique device developed by the lab as is so often the case with cutting edge research we ourselves make decisions on how to proceed with our research although the process was very challenging it was a rewarding three years because what i did immediately led to outcomes sato at the physical society of japan annual meeting asahi lab s active feedback nuclear spin maser can you tell us about your doctoral dissertation the title of my dissertation is study of spin maser comagnetometry for the xe atomic edm experiment an electric dipole moment edm is the polarization of electric charge of the neutral atom the existence of the edm has not been confirmed yet but if experimentally confirmed will be a clear indication of a new physics i e supersymmetry beyond the currently accepted theory the so called standard model in order to search for the edm the spin precession frequency of the atom under the static electric and magnetic fields is measured precisely in order to improve the measurement sensitivity we introduced a xe atom to our active nuclear spin maser the xe maser was developed and its performance was evaluated as a result it was suggested that the xe maser has potential for improving the current experimental limit of the xe atomic edm what are your post graduation plans i will continue research on fundamental symmetry with atoms at riken graduation is a starting point for new phase in my life and i will expand my horizons by building on my experience at tokyo tech do you have any message for younger students tokyo tech has a leading edge research environment not to mention great facilities the research and discussion with leading faculty was stimulating tokyo tech faculty members offered a great deal of support while giving me a free hand in doing research i would like to recommend tokyo tech to those who are considering master s and doctoral degree programs the institute s door is wide open if you have a will to explore things in depth your own perspective and vision will be your lifelong strength why did you go on to a doctoral degree program at tokyo tech i did so because i found research interesting after completing a bachelor s degree program at tokyo tech i advanced to a master s and then a doctoral degree program i was affiliated with a lab for six years and conducted research on living creatures many things don t go as planned or as expected when you do the kind of research i do and you often don t get immediate results even when you take time to prepare research might not go smoothly due to the poor condition of the living beings on that particular day but precisely for that reason i feel an especially strong sense of accomplishment when my research goes well what was your most memorable experience during your time at tokyo tech the various lab events were truly memorable as a doctoral student life is naturally centered on research but the lab i was affiliated with also organized lots of barbecues excursions and other outdoor activities we went sightseeing cherry blossom viewing and even cooked a baumkuchen cake using bamboo at a barbecue members got along very well in the lab and sometimes we went out for drinks in my research i worked hard and in my free time i played hard lab s welcome party for new students miyagi far left lab s excursion to kurobe dam miyagi far left can you tell us about your doctoral dissertation my doctoral dissertation is entitled analysis of regulatory mechanism of cardiac specific expression of zebrafish cx in this study to investigate the transcriptional regulation of cx gene expression i characterized the cx promoter activity in zebrafish embryos the results show that its early cardiac restricted expression is regulated by promoter transactivation in the embryonic heart and suppresses promoter activity in skeletal muscles what are your post graduation plans i obtained a job at a pharmaceutical company and will engage in research on the development of ethical drugs frankly i am a little anxious because i have never studied pharmaceutics or medicine and my research at tokyo tech had little to do with drug development even so i will do my utmost by taking advantage of what i learned through research at tokyo tech do you have any message for younger students expose yourselves to various knowledge and ideas beyond your specialty during your time at tokyo tech and gain your own perspective and view to generate action your learning and research at university work as your strength to land jobs but your own perspective and vision will be your lifelong strength tokyo tech gives you a chance to exchange views with a variety of people with varying perspectives and ideas which will be your strength for life always keep your heart and mind on your goals what led you to choose japan and tokyo tech nishihara lab trip to hakone avancena second row far right before coming to japan i was a computer science cs teacher in a premier science and technology high school in the philippines as a youth educator i knew i needed to do graduate studies luckily i qualified for the monbukagakusho scholarship so i searched extensively for a japanese university that would accommodate the research i am interested in then i chanced upon the department of human system science at tokyo tech which aims to develop systems that integrate human factors with science and technology as i am interested in how students learn computer science and how technology is utilized in education i applied to this department in and have been a member of professor akinori nishihara s lab since then the last seven years have been a fulfillment of my long time dream of living in japan a country which i admire for its nature culture and technological innovations during your time at tokyo tech what experiences made the biggest impression on you studying at tokyo tech provided me with opportunities to undergo a holistic personal growth the seminars conferences and research activities deepened and widened my knowledge in my field of interest which is computer science education the friendships i made with people from various cultures mainly through the international dormitories and friendship clubs my classmates and labmates are treasures i will always value being the head of the association of filipino students in japan during the great east japan earthquake also made a lasting mark on me because with the help of other officers and volunteers i had to coordinate a safety check on the filipino scholars in japan not to mention i was six months pregnant at that time most importantly i am grateful to nishihara sensei an advocate of women in engineering whose encouragement allowed me to obtain recognition and scholarships and to participate in google s girls leading in development and engineering and the grace hopper celebration of women in computing the largest gathering of women in computer science moreover his support made it possible for me to finish two degrees at tokyo tech while taking care of my two sons who were both born here in japan with other filipino scholars during the asean youth festival at komaba dormitory avancena second row th from left with other anita borg scholars at a google retreat in seoul korea avancena far right avancena participating as a google scholar at the grace hopper conference in baltimore maryland can you tell me about your doctoral dissertation my doctoral dissertation entailed developing an algorithm learning tool which incorporates algorithm visualization av the research is an attempt to address the issues of poor performance and low motivation among high school students of computer science the learning tool presents lessons and animations that aim to facilitate teaching and learning of fundamental algorithms which are included in the k cs curriculum ultimately the goal is to propose models consisting of av features learning objectives motivation components learning strategies and actual student performance which may be considered in the design and assessment of algorithm learning tools intended for novice programmers the study is focused on high school students but it also has repercussions on university level cs what are your post graduation plans doing research in cs education and obtaining a phd with this background is relevant to my plans of pursuing a teaching career in the university computer science is a popular course in my country but cs education has yet to be given its much needed attention i therefore see myself working in this field promoting cs education and doing research and advocacy in cs curriculum design and implementation both in the secondary and tertiary levels i would also like to get involved in teacher education in the field of cs and ict which i believe is a key to enhancing not only computer science but stem education in general in the philippines there is a pressing need to produce more scientists and engineers for the purpose of national development so having competent teachers in computing and technology is a huge prerequisite i would also like to help address the issues and challenges in cs in particular how to encourage more women to join and persevere in this field do you have any message for younger international students each person has a unique story so my message for those who have come to japan to pursue their studies especially here at tokyo tech is that whatever situation you may find yourself in always keep your heart and mind on your goals the life of a foreign student can be both exciting and challenging but it is always a personal decision to stay on track look for friends and groups that are good influences and will give you encouragement during hard times never hesitate to consult with your supervisor and those who can give you sound advice always find time to reflect which is necessary when research work gets hectic make sure you have time for fun and relaxation experience japan s beautiful nature and its rich culture and win many friends as you do so lastly try to consider how you can give back to society after having finished your studies here in japan heartfelt congratulations to sato miyagi avancena and many other students graduating from tokyo tech this spring the special topics component of the tokyo tech website shines a spotlight on recent developments in research and education achievements of its community

sergei manzhos quantum chemistry and ai uncovering the potential of renewable energy materials faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue sergei manzhos department of chemical science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology we all understand the importance of renewable energy technologies devices such as solar panels and fuel cells can help us realise a greener future by adding much needed capacity and flexibility to the energy grid but much research work is still required to improve these to achieve economically and ecologically sustainable technologies and these research efforts often remain a mystery to much of the public tokyo tech s school of materials and chemical technology includes many labs working in areas that help develop solutions to society s energy needs one in particular is ihara manzhos laboratory where associate professor sergei manzhos is busy exploring the world of materials science through theory and modeling with a strong focus on quantum chemistry and artificial intelligence ai he uses these to accelerate the processes of simulation and refinement of materials necessary for the next generation of renewable energy and other technologies the origins of a broad approach manzhos has studied and researched at several universities around the world in canada singapore his country of origin ukraine and now for the second time in his career japan while he values his time and experiences at each of the universities in each of the countries he s lived and worked in he feels the academic scene in japan suits him well and so has been with tokyo tech since though he started out with a degree in physics and radio electronics manzhos has gradually expanded into chemistry mathematics and computational modeling my background probably sounds a bit broad doesn t it said manzhos in a recent interview but i find all these different things i ve done in all these different places come in useful to me on a daily basis as what i do each day can too be very broad this includes improving modeling methods to make a simulation reflect reality more accurately while using algorithms that run more efficiently but this is done for specific applications such as development of novel solar or fuel cell materials and therefore expertise in these fields is also required and of course my colleagues and i spend a lot of time working on basic theory which naturally informs these other things and dictates our direction one such theoretical area is quantum chemistry the phrase quantum chemistry might sound like something more likely to be uttered in a science fiction movie than in a real science lab but it s actually a well established field that uses quantum theory to describe chemical phenomena the idea comes from the fact that the classical way of thinking about elements as solid points of mass charge and so on limits what characteristics you can predict about materials made using those chemicals using the quantum theory allows researchers to better estimate the characteristics of materials or to evaluate properties that are not accessible with classic approaches such as light absorption conductance or vibrational spectra researchers can search for materials more efficiently using computers rather than traditional bench experiments making the approach invaluable in r ampd the use of ai in material science and beyond so we use quantum chemistry to simulate components of things like solar panels fuel cells batteries and other electrical devices the problem is it is typically computationally intensive to run simulations based on quantum chemistry therefore this dictates a direction for us to refine existing algorithms and find different methods of implementing quantum chemistry in a computer said manzhos common algorithms for such things use a mathematical technique called linear algebra matrix computations and we investigate new ways to code these algorithms so that the composite simulations are as accurate as we need them to be while reducing the number of computational steps required to carry out some operation or another as linear algebra has wide ranging applications including things like image analysis some of our work can find use in fields outside materials science as well but by far the most impactful thing in the realm of computing that we deal with is of course ai ai has shaped our daily lives in some obvious and some more indirect ways the nature of ai is often glossed over in the media which can present it as something mysterious and hard to understand not that it s easy but seeing it as what it really is deep down a highly sophisticated way of spotting patterns and generating outputs data or decisions makes it easier to see how it can be useful in a field like materials science manzhos and his team use ai in a few different ways for example to model the electrical grid to predict materials properties or to enhance simulations often the data he works on is highly dimensional containing a large number of variables which may also depend on each other and also many different data types ai is advantageous for such applications due to its ability to uncover implicit information in large and possibly heterogeneous datasets something that may be difficult or impossible with traditional techniques many instances of ai used in modeling don t necessitate a great level of accuracy for example let s say you re predicting power consumption by the hour in an energy grid the smallest number you might be concerned about is something like watts one led bulb that figure might represent percent maybe a little less the consumption of a household so the ai needed for such modeling doesn t need to be so accurate said manzhos but for some of the applications we work on including ai for improving quantum chemistry based modeling methods we might need times the accuracy of that we often run into the limits of what contemporary ai can achieve hence the reason we adapt existing algorithms to our needs and also develop novel algorithms that can then be used in other areas as well refining basic processes has far reaching benefits manzhos initially turned to ai as a means to try and solve problems that did not have efficient solutions using classical means to solve them one such example is a class of functions called interatomic potentials these are needed to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms in other words how much energy a molecule has that can be converted into another form under some process an everyday example of where such functions might be useful is when engineers are creating something that might expand or contract with a change in temperature but as these functions can require long exhaustive searches for solutions unless one is willing to settle for simple but not very accurate approximations which take a lot of computing time and energy ai can be applied instead machine learning is advantageous as it can build a solution without the researchers predetermining its form electron wavefunction distribution in a molecule shown as isosurface potential energy landscape shown as isosurface in which li ions move in a solid state battery electrolyte this however becomes increasingly difficult as the dimensionality of the problem increases and one gets hit by the so called curse of dimensionality reflected in particular in an exponentially growing need for more and more data to build a reliable model dr manzhos and colleagues have been developing novel machine learning algorithms capable of building reliable models even in very high dimensional spaces and from sparse data these algorithms are hybrids of neural networks gaussian process regressions and an approach known as hdmr high dimensional model representation that is a framework for representing high dimensional functions with low dimensional terms some other areas of study manzhos applies ai to have existing industrial or governmental counterparts such as the modeling of energy consumption this is something that energy organizations have to deal with they can therefore benefit from developments made by his group other researchers benefit from the work manzhos does on improving simulation capabilities at the quantum scale in particular by making them applicable to more realistic lengthscales for example some scientific fields explore expressions of quantum phenomena including things like protein folding essential for medical developments a common method used for some quantum modeling is called density functional theory dft however it too is computationally expensive manzhos explores alternatives to this method as it is a bottleneck to modeling materials despite being widely used at present manzhos and colleagues recently proposed a machine learning based improvement to a dft alternative called density functional tight binding dftb and used it to compute an interface of si siox tio which are important materials in silicon perovskite tandem solar cells the team demonstrated that although modeling the thousands of atoms required by the interface would be an unfeasible task for dft it was a relatively easy calculation for the dftb method this in turn illustrated how their improvement makes the dftb method applicable to a wider range of materials engineering around the limitations of conventional methods like dft will allow researchers to model materials in unprecedented detail and potentially without the need for newer more expensive hardware this could also improve accessibility to research methods as more costly alternatives might be out of reach to many around the world kinetic energy densities of al mg and si crystals which manzhos and his team model to develop large scale dft methods the importance of basic research and interdisciplinary research i hope our research can be useful in other ways too of course providing new algorithms to the world has its uses and obviously renewable energy technologies are increasingly important but i think our efforts in quantum chemistry for basic materials research could help in far less obvious ways said manzhos for example it might surprise you to know that only relatively recently did china one of the world s industrial powerhouses gain the expertise to make the tips for ballpoint pens something so humble you probably take it for granted but the specific way the ball point is made required specific expertise in metallurgy and manufacturing techniques some key elements of understanding what happens inside a steel which might sound like a boring material in the age of metaverses were only acquired in the st century my point is sometimes remarkably basic research is needed to spawn new products and industries even if they re conceptually simple and it s often the case that this basic research is related to materials and phenomena important in daily life the reason the work of manzhos and his team can be useful in so many different contexts is because at its core it s highly interdisciplinary combining many fields that have already been mentioned though not limited to quantum chemistry an increasing number of research groups around the world are embracing the idea of interdisciplinary practice as a way to add coherence to otherwise disparate fields of study and encourage a more holistic approach to carrying out research i don t think research should be siloed this idea of breadth is important as the challenges of today cannot be met if you only focus on minute details we need to think in a wider context the different areas i ve worked in and continue to explore have given me the opportunity to build a career by keeping my interests broad but also detailed where needs be without being overly general or excessively narrow and specific said manzhos this way of carrying out research requires a certain agility and a lot of flexibility but i have become very comfortable with that and i actually think that such an environment can be rewarding and motivational especially for students strategy to help students discover their potential at ihara manzhos laboratory manzhos leads the group s materials modeling component while professor manabu ihara also of the school of materials and chemical technology leads the experimental component from materials to renewable energy systems their respective approaches work in synergy while also offering newcomers a wide range of research opportunities in some ways as our lab includes so many overlapping fields i think it can be an easy sell to prospective students manzhos continued students and early career researchers coming to our lab can easily find some area or another that suits them and their goals in fact by design we encourage new starters to sort of bounce around the lab trying different things and exploring what s on offer it s a strategy to help people discover their potential maybe they re into running experiments or perhaps they prefer desk work working on theoretical problems our lab can suit different personality types which may be reflected in different ways of carrying out research essentially students can join as generalists and become more specialized in time i hope this direction inspires the next generation as much as it has my own referencing the environmental energy innovation building where ihara manzhos laboratory is housed manzhos concluded one thing s for sure our building is certainly a source for inspiration it expresses some of our core values in its physical make up by showing off solar panels and integrating fuel cell technology it helps solidify some of the more abstract ideas we might experience throughout the course of our studies it s worth coming to see if you happen to be in the area the environmental energy innovation building which professor manabu ihara played a significant role in designing is covered with solar panels its smart energy system ene swallow enables efficient operation of distributed power supply and a unique power prediction model based on real time data is used to perform peak cut control density functional theory dft density functional theory dft is a computational method used in physics and chemistry to understand the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules instead of dealing with the complex wave functions of individual electrons dft looks at electron density i e the distribution of electrons in space to describe a system s total energy dft can provide valuable insights into the molecular structures reaction energies and electronic properties of materials density functional based tight binding dftb density functional based tight binding dftb is a quantum mechanical method used for simulating the electronic structure and properties of materials the tight binding approach simplifies electronic structure calculations by approximating the electron electron interactions dftb takes the method a step further by introducing electron density functional approximations allowing for a more accurate description of the electronic structure compared to traditional tight binding methods associate

appliances and automobiles communicate via networks and are controlled from moment to moment for example today s automobiles are equipped with about electronic control units these units control everything from engines and brakes to air conditioning through the in vehicle network moving forward as autonomous driving advances communication will expand beyond in vehicle equipment to include external networks for example there will be communication among vehicles and various sensors installed in urban environments this will enable even more advanced control control is also fulfilling an increasingly important role in the energy field currently the introduction of smart grids is being promoted to prevent global warming a smart grid is a power grid that uses ict to efficiently distribute power by automatically controlling power supply and demand in real time this is expected to promote the optimization of power generation facilities and the introduction of renewable energy a system that uses ict in the cyberspace to control devices in the physical space is called a cyber physical system cps by linking devices and ict and feeding back the results of data analysis in the cyberspace to devices it is possible to achieve even more optimal control of devices in response to changes in the environment cpss are gaining importance not only in autonomous driving and smart grids but also in various fields such as disaster response by robots and aerial transportation by drones professor hideaki ishii school of computing has been focusing on cpss from an early stage and researching the related control theory ishii was one of the first researchers to realize the essential issues in fusing control theory and ict and his achievements in researching theory for that purpose have been highly regarded in ishii was awarded the title of fellow by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee which is the world s most distinguished organization in the fields of electrical electronics and computer engineering three directions of research centered on control engineering based on control engineering ishii is currently conducting theoretical research on cpss in three directions communication constraints large scale multi agent systems and security and learning figure each direction of research is introduced in detail below figure three axes of theoretical research on cps first we discuss communication constraints networks have been installed in automobiles and factories since the s says ishii when explaining the history of control through networks transmission delay is just a minor annoyance when browsing the internet on a smartphone or personal computer however transmission delay is a serious problem when controlling an engine or brakes even a delay of just seconds between braking and stopping can lead to a serious accident furthermore when multiple systems share a single communication network it is extremely important to determine which system should be given priority for use as explained by ishii communication networks used for control have their own unique constraints in the s no one was examining the theoretical issues in these systems explains ishii professor roger brockett of harvard university first raised this issue around at the time i was a doctoral student in the department of electrical and computer engineering at the university of toronto canada i recognized the new possibilities that communication networks bring to control engineering and decided to make it the theme of my doctoral dissertation this was a major turning point for my research until this day i have been conducting research to link control theory with the theory of information and communication in the american mathematician norbert wiener to proposed the fusion of control and communication technology in his influential book cybernetics however it is interesting that the past years are the first time that systematic theoretical research has truly been performed quantized control corresponding to communication constraints ishii cites the inverted pendulum as an example to explain the fundamentals of using networked control to stabilize an ever changing unstable system that is under communication constraints in this system a rod that can be tilted in any direction by degrees is placed on a dolly a motor is used to move the dolly and control is performed to prevent the rod from falling over a sensor is used to measure the angle between the dolly and the rod in real time and the posture of the rod is controlled based on that angle instead of imagining a dolly this example is easier to understand if you imagine a long thin stick standing on the palm of your hand you can prevent the stick from falling over by moving your hand back and forth suppose that we use a communication network to connect a sensor that measures the angle of the rod and a controller that determines the movement of the dolly explains ishii at this time in order to reduce the amount of communication used for control we must reduce the amount of measurement data sent from the sensor as much as possible it is important to clarify the extent to which the amount of data can be reduced in response ishii devised a method called quantized control the rod can fall in any direction of degrees however these directions can be divided into segments for example degrees can be divided into segments of degrees each and the sensor can measure which segment the rod is in quantized control is such a process of converting physical quantities that take continuous values into discrete values for control this makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of information as an extreme case it is conceivable to reduce the number of segments to two however if the only information available is that the rod has tilted to the right or left from an upright position the rod will quickly fall over therefore it is necessary to perform control while predicting the movements of the system using a mathematical formula that serves as its physical model in an unstable system the degree of instability is represented by a value called the unstable pole explains ishii in an inverted pendulum the mass and length of the rod determine the unstable pole assuming that rods have the same mass the longer the rod the greater the stability one interesting fact is that the theoretical minimum required speed for the communication network is determined solely by the value of the unstable pole what is a multi agent system next let us move on to large scale multi agent systems when discussing communication constraints we introduced an example related to automobile control this example referred to the control of a single vehicle however as autonomous driving progresses in the future control will advance through communication networks among vehicles and with various sensors in the urban environment this is the research on large scale multi agent systems multi agent means that there are many agents and each agent makes decisions autonomously however the system as a whole aims to behave in a specific way multi agent research targets are wide ranging active research is being conducted for applications such as autonomous driving of automobiles flight control of drones and sensor networks using wireless communication furthermore through these mathematical models it is possible to use multi agents to examine phenomena such as how covid spreads how people s opinions spread on social media and how cranial nerves synchronize in our brains ishii reconsidered multi agents from the viewpoint of control theory and is researching their control methods sensor networks drone formation flight smart grids autonomous driving as his underlying idea ishii cites the collective behavior of flocks of birds and fish as an example there is no leader in the group each autonomous individual changes direction and speed at its own will however let s assume that there is an intention to gather together as a group and move in a certain direction individuals can only see their close companions according to ishii the most important point in such multi agent systems is the communication of information among agents figure shows a method of mathematical expression known as a graph in this graph the numbered circles represent agents the arrows connecting numbered circles represent the connection between agents i e the transmission of information in figure there are eight agents who exchange information with a limited number of fellow agents and update the direction of their own behavior explains ishii matching directions means that the angle difference between your own direction and the other agent s direction is this state is known as a consensus in the field of algorithms the consensus problem is a very important problem when considering multi agents figure network of agents distributed control that is resistant to failures and abnormalities in particular there has recently been extensive research on consensus algorithms for cases in which a system contains agents that behave abnormally figure suppose you have a selfish agent in your group who doesn t care about the other members says ishii even if all members agree a system will not be reliable if it is impacted by such a selfish agent when certain agents behave significantly differently from others the system works well by ignoring such agents on the other hand this raises the new problem of how many agents that behave abnormally can be tolerated here the important point is that the denser the connections between agents in the system the more abnormal agents that can be tolerated this is also a problem for distributed algorithms in the computer science field ishii s research clarified the minimum connection conditions that a network should satisfy figure consensus in a multi agent system including anomalous agents such research is directly linked to safe operation of autonomous distributed control i am also working on distributed control for smart grids in the energy field says ishii moving forward i believe that an increasing amount of research will be conducted on autonomous distributed control that is resistant to failures and abnormalities cybersecurity issues in control ishii is in fact involved in research on security in large scale cyber physical systems this is the last direction security and learning in the case of control via a communication network there is the risk that someone with malicious intent will tamper with information thereby causing control to be performed differently than expected therefore ishii is researching security from the perspective of control theory to determine to which extent a system can withstand attacks in a large scale cyber physical system like the one shown in figure there is a physical network in the physical space and a control communication network in the cyberspace these two networks are linked to each other through local monitoring and control for example jamming of communications and falsification of control information are assumed as attacks on communication networks describes ishii the scary thing about such attacks is that they can change control command signals and manipulate devices in the physical space to behave abnormally i am currently conducting theoretical research on methods for detecting attacks from both the physical space and the cyberspace this research has created new perspectives that did not exist in the past in control theory this is because this line of work also examines the perspective of the attacker and considers the completely opposite problem of implementing control in the worst possible way for the system of course based on such research ishii s job is to propose methods for constructing safer systems he is also conducting research to improve performance by having ai learn the communication patterns of cyberattacks in this way as large scale cyber physical systems continue to spread i feel that theoretical research in fields fusing control and information communication is rapidly increasing in importance says ishii distributed system mechanism for cyberattack detection and robust control figure cyber physical security a path in the footsteps of kalman what spurred ishii s desire to study control theory as a child i had the opportunity to live overseas explains ishii upon returning to japan i had a vague wish to work internationally in the future i became interested in theoretical research when i was wondering what path to choose during my sophomore year at the university of tsukuba in particular i was fascinated by the story of how a prominent engineer named rudolf kalman to laid the foundations of control theory almost all by himself in the s the story inspired me to pursue this field i also liked that it is fundamental to different branches of engineering such as mechanical electrical aerospace and so on afterward ishii entered the master s program at kyoto university following his studies there he went on to the doctoral program at the university of toronto after working as a postdoctoral associate at the university of illinois in the united states he entered the tokyo institute of technology in currently i really enjoy engaging in interdisciplinary joint research with colleagues from all over the world says ishii that is the real thrill of research in closing ishii gave the following message to young people who want to become researchers in order to establish a career as a researcher it is important to think deeply and continue over the long term explains ishii in addition to finding a field that interests you it is good to find a research style that suits you for example while theoretical research may seem like a solo effort it is becoming increasingly important to develop new fields through discussions and collaboration with researchers from different fields international research activities are also essential for that reason i strongly recommend studying abroad at an early stage which should include improving your english skills i hope that young researchers will be curious and seek to expand their research networks professor hideaki ishii department of computer science school of

chihiro yoshimura conserving the aquatic environments of rivers and lakes incorporating ecosystems in environmental management faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue chihiro yoshimura school of environment and society department of civil and environmental engineering environmental problems such as global warming plastic pollution and ecosystem degradation are widespread and increasingly complex many of these problems are related to water among the sustainable development goals sdgs which are international goals for achieving a better and more sustainable world by there are goals to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development recently efforts to improve water usage and the aquatic environment are gaining momentum worldwide under these circumstances professor chihiro yoshimura department of civil and environmental engineering school of environment and society has been researching the aquatic environment for many years with a focus on rivers and lakes aquatic environments are essential to human life from early on i wanted to contribute to a field that directly relates to people s lives for example social infrastructure explains yoshimura with that in mind i chose the department of civil engineering at tokyo tech and joined a laboratory for environmental water quality engineering focusing on aquatic environments such as rivers and lakes i have been working on this research theme ever since an aquatic environment includes not only rivers and lakes but also the activities of people living in the surrounding areas and the ecosystems affected by those activities yoshimura s research involves assessing such aquatic ecosystems from the viewpoint of water safety and the living environment based on those assessments he considers how to create sustainable relationships between regional communities and nature yoshimura is currently focusing on three areas environmental photochemistry development of water quality models and evaluation of ecosystem functions understanding how photochemical reactions affect water quality and biocenosis the first area environmental photochemistry deals with photochemical reactions in the natural environment as the name suggests photochemical reactions are reactions caused by light energy yoshimura is exploring the photochemical reactions that occur in aquatic environments and their engineering applications organic compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals flow into rivers through various types of wastewater and sewage many of these substances exhibit endocrine disruption and ecotoxicity in aquatic ecosystems while others are degraded by photochemical reactions the photosynthesis of phytoplankton algae etc is well known as a photochemical reaction however photochemical reactions that do not involve living organisms are actually always occurring in water exposed to light together with biodegradation by microorganisms such photodegradation is recognized as a self cleaning action of the environment furthermore in recent years marine pollution has been occurring in the form of microplastics we know that these plastics are also degraded in the environment mainly by the two actions of photodegradation and biodegradation in this way photochemical reactions are important reactions in aquatic environments understanding the processes of photochemical reactions in organisms and substances will enable us to better manage chemical substances aquatic environments and ecosystems degradation of organic compounds in aquatic environments can occur through photochemical reactions as well as by bacteria photochemical reactions can be divided into direct photolysis and indirect photolysis via radicals zhongyu guo et al water research water treatment technology using photocatalysts however not much progress has been made in understanding photochemical reactions in aquatic environments this is one of the reasons why the management and regulation of pollutants are inadequate therefore by researching environmental photochemistry yoshimura hopes to propose effective management methods for aquatic environments he also aims to realize new water treatment technologies by applying photochemical reactions in aquatic environments in the laboratory yoshimura acquires data through the organic combination of modeling based on surveys of rivers and lakes in japan and overseas and on experiments related to environmental photochemistry in water treatment using photocatalysts if technology can be developed that synergizes with the photochemical reactions in water it would be possible to secure safe water even in areas where electricity is not available as long as there is sunlight this technology could be used in regions such as developing countries and mountainous areas photocatalytic reactor the center of the device is equipped with a xenon lamp which emits light in a spectrum similar to that of sunlight test tubes are placed around the lamp which induces photochemical reactions this makes it possible to replicate the photochemical reactions that occur under various water quality conditions in other words it is possible to determine how organic pollutants in water change due to photochemical reactions furthermore by obtaining concentration data over time it is possible to clarify elements such as reaction pathways and reaction rates using simulations to understand lake ecosystems and achieve environmental conservation yoshimura s second area of focus is development of a water quality model this is an effort to use a numerical model to describe the aquatic environment yoshimura constructed a water quality model for lake water for example if a pollutant flows into a lake it is possible to use a simulation to predict how the pollutant will diffuse over time and how the biomass of organisms in the water will change it is also possible to visualize the space time distribution of these concentrations incidentally yoshimura is currently focusing on lakes because chemical and biological reactions are more likely to occur in lake water than in rivers one result of this research was an international project that targeted lake tonle sap in cambodia and was led by yoshimura from april to march jst jica satreps meeting on the environmental management of lake tonle sap at the cambodian tonle sap authority lake tonle sap is located in the central region of cambodia it boasts the largest area of any lake in southeast asia with a total length of about kilometers local people use lake tonle sap and its floodplain for farming and fishing the vast flood plains that are temporarily submerged in water also play an important role in maintaining biodiversity in the mekong basin however over the past decade or so development has progresse in the basin and environmental pollution of the lake has become a growing concern a floating village on lake tonle sap conducting an on site survey of sediment dynamics conducting an on site survey of sediment dynamics on how the project started yoshimura explains when i first visited tonle sap lake in there were concerns about how the lake was being impacted by the construction of a dam and hydroelectric power plant upstream on the river at that time the lake was a rich and valuable ecosystem and i felt that it was worthy of being registered as a natural heritage site i thought it would be very meaningful to scientifically clarify the characteristics of the lake for having it designated as a world natural heritage site and ensuring conservation therefore i started collaborative research with a researcher from the institute of technology of cambodia eutrophication had become a problem at that time and it created the issue of excess organisms and organic matter this makes it difficult to use the lake water as tap water and agricultural water furthermore if oxygen deficiency occurs as a result of eutrophication the fish population will drop significantly it was therefore necessary to ascertain the movement in levels of nutrient sources such as phosphoric acid in this project yoshimura collaborated with laboratories inside and outside of tokyo tech to construct a water quality model for the movement of water and various substances that flow from rivers into lakes thereby enabling replication through simulations simulation of phytoplankton concentration in lake tonle sap based on seasonal flood patterns sediment dynamics and phosphorus dynamics the simulation replicates the space time distribution of phytoplankton concentration a water quality model constructed in this way enables various simulations simply by changing the parameters for example because it is possible to predict changes in the aquatic environment of lakes as global warming progresses yoshimura plans to apply this water quality model to other lakes including those in japan currently management of aquatic environments in japan is based on environmental monitoring which usually examines water quality and species explains yoshimura environmental monitoring is an important task for clarifying the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems however countermeasures inevitably fall one step behind by using simulations to predict future impact we can implement effective measures in advance instead of trying to improve things after they have deteriorated for example there are about dammed lakes in japan presently water quality management is based on environmental monitoring however in the future applying water quality models will enable more rational environmental management therefore yoshimura is currently working on a project running from april to march in collaboration with the water resources environment center wec the project aims to understand photochemical reactions on the water surface of dammed lakes and to model the decomposition of organic pollutants this project also comprises the generation of blue green algae and the photodecomposition reaction of organic matter particularly in dammed lakes until now dam managers have engaged in trial and error for measures to prevent blooming of blue green algae explains yoshimura in the future i would like to formulate efficient countermeasures by conducting simulations using water quality models in addition to being desirable in terms of various types of water usage suppressing the growth of blue green algae will also lead to conservation of dammed lake ecosystems the international project targeting lake tonle sap ended in march currently an organization established at the institute of technology of cambodia is responsible for conservation and management of lake tonle sap in environmental conservation research it is also important for local people to take ownership of conservation and management of the natural environment this will make it possible to achieve sustainability explains yoshimura therefore the project also focused on providing training to the local community i have high expectations for their research results and environmental conservation efforts and i will certainly keep an eye on their future activities meeting with the mayors of floating villages while obtaining cooperation for surveys in local villages yoshimura also provided training for young cambodian researchers university students and local residents exploring ecosystem management methodologies with social benefits yoshimura s third area of focus is the evaluation of ecosystem functions he states of course preventing pollution is extremely important however as a further step i would like to achieve environmental management that can better utilize the functions of the ecosystem this means considering environmental management methods that increase the benefits to society while maintaining the ecosystem for example making it possible to have high quality fishery resources while still maintaining a healthy ecosystem therefore by making full use of an aquatic environment model that incorporates ecosystem functions we are tackling the issue of what kind of environmental management can enhance ecosystem services integration of ecosystem services into aquatic ecosystem models improving and integrating various environmental models and enabling the quantitative evaluation of ecosystem functions and ecosystem services will contribute to achieving a sustainable society nature based solutions solutions to social issues rooted in nature ecosystem services are the benefits that human society receives from ecosystems this concept has attracted attention in recent years ecosystem services contain everything that society depends on from the natural world such as water and fish for example by adding a parameter that describes the growth of fish to the water quality model it is possible to determine the extent to which a particular method of farming in the river watershed will ultimately change fishery production another example would be determining the approximate amount of water usage in an upstream dammed lake that would make it impossible to maintain the fishery production amount furthermore if it is possible to use simulations to visualize the benefits of the aquatic environment for residents living nearby and to predict future effects quantitatively we will be able to optimize use of the aquatic environment for society in recent years this concept has been expressed as green infrastructure or nature based solutions nbs these ways of thinking emphasize utilizing the mechanisms of nature and ecosystems in society such efforts will reduce carbon dioxide emissions and lead to the achievement of a sustainable society the aquatic environment is part of nature so i would like to contribute to society by developing tools for the aquatic environment says yoshimura ultimately i hope that this will lead to achieving sdgs integration of ecosystem services into aquatic ecosystem models improving and integrating various environmental models and enabling the quantitative evaluation of ecosystem functions and ecosystem services will contribute to achieving a sustainable society nature based solutions solutions to social issues rooted in nature the joy of aquatic environment research as an interdisciplinary field yoshimura describes the joy of conducting his research as follows i studied abroad at the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag in switzerland for one year during my second year in the doctoral program eawag is a national research institute specializing in water and environment my experience at eawag was the first time that i belonged to an ecology laboratory and learned how interesting ecology truly is my background is in engineering but being exposed to research fields in the sciences greatly broadened my horizons in fact the aquatic environment is an interdisciplinary field that involves both engineering and science i felt that one of the main appeals of my research is the ability to learn from both disciplines as initiatives for sdgs are currently gaining momentum worldwide yoshimura s research is attracting even greater attention from among the sdgs my research is deeply related to goal ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all goal conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development and goal protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss that being said the sdgs have not changed my research all the sdgs are important social issues that should have been resolved even before being defined as sdgs i will continue to conduct research on the aquatic environment with the aim of achieving a sustainable society in closing yoshimura gave the following message to young people aiming to become researchers personally studying abroad in switzerland was an invaluable experience therefore rather than staying at the same university from undergraduate to graduate school i recommend that you actively change your environment and take on new challenges such as studying abroad moving to another university or finding employment also beginning from their time in school i hope that students will earnestly pursue their own interests and confront their problem awareness without being influenced by the thoughts of people around them taking such an attitude will broaden your horizons and enrich your life radicals highly reactive atoms and molecules containing unpaired electrons includes reactive oxygen species eutrophication a natural phenomenon in which closed bodies of water such as lakes and dammed reservoirs change from oligotrophic to eutrophic with a high concentration of nutrients this change is caused by the supply of nutrients such as nitrogen compounds and phosphoric acid from the watershed blue green algae a state in which microalgae grow in large numbers near the water surface in lakes and marshes where eutrophication is progressing this phenomenon makes the water surface a blue green color professor chihiro yoshimura school of environment and

yoshihiro tonegawa from soap films to black holes exploring the mathematics of minimal surfaces faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue yoshihiro tonegawa professor department of mathematics school of science plateau s problem named after physicist joseph plateau belgium relates to the minimal area of a curved surface in three dimensional space as an example if you were to bend a piece of wire and then dip it in soapy water a soap film would form and the mathematical properties of its shape could be understood surprisingly the mathematics of soap films is closely connected with a wide range of fields including the shapes of black holes the combustion surfaces in engine turbines and annealing in metalworking professor yoshihiro tonegawa of the department of mathematics school of science is a leading researcher on mean curvature flow applying its concepts to explore the mathematics field known as geometric measure theory geometric measure theory understanding shapes whose areas cannot be calculated using formulas discoveries that become breakthroughs for mathematicians only occur once every few years or once a decade that s why there is such a strong feeling of excitement at those moments tonegawa himself a mathematician discussed the appeal of mathematics his research topics are geometric measure theory and mean curvature flow these are technical terms that some readers may not be familiar with so we begin with a basic introduction first of all what is geometric measure theory put simply this theory relates to understanding geometrical objects by measuring their area measure theory means theories for measuring quantity in elementary and junior high school we learn formulas to calculate the areas of circles quadrilaterals and other shapes then in high school we use calculus to find the areas of more complex figures however there are many complicated figures whose areas cannot be calculated using these methods so how can the areas of such figures be determined the field of geometric measure theory emerged from an awareness of such problems research on geometric measure theory is currently divided into two broad areas one area studies complex sets like fractals where the overall shape is similar to its parts and the other area studies fields related to plateau s problem dealing with curved surfaces in three dimensional space i am studying the latter says tonegawa minimal surfaces occur in many natural phenomena let s try to understand plateau s problem as simply as possible imagine that you were to take a piece of wire and bend it into an arbitrary closed shape when you then dip that frame in soapy water and remove it a soap film is formed inside the frame if there is no wind the soap film becomes a static smooth curved surface how was the shape of this soap film determined naturally we can imagine that the soap film itself has a kind of pulling force or tension which means the shape is determined by creating the smallest area possible if you dip a wire frame into soapy water and then remove it a soap film will be formed inside the frame this soap film can be considered a very thin mathematically curved surface plateau s problem is a mathematical idealization of this phenomenon when you create an arbitrary closed curve the problem is mathematically proving that there is a curved surface that has a curved boundary with the smallest possible area more simply it can be thought of as asking a serious mathematical question about whether a soap film can be formed regardless of the shape of the wire frame when dipped in soapy water this seems simple but it is actually a difficult problem that requires advanced mathematical knowledge including knowledge related to the nature of curved surfaces and their areas tonegawa explains the area of a plane is for flat objects while plateau s problem is for curved surfaces that is the area of curved objects in three dimensions which makes things much more complicated a curved surface with the smallest possible area is called a minimal surface in mathematics so plateau s problem is also called the minimal surface problem now let go even deeper the curvatures of each of the two red dotted lines are the two principal curvatures soap films are curved surfaces that physically exist and the surface is perfectly smooth if you look closely you will notice that the soap film curves like a horse saddle and the degree of the curve is perfectly balanced vertically at each point as the figure shows there are two principal curvatures which are quantities representing the degree to which a curved surface bends a principal curvature is defined at each point along the curved surface and the average value of the two principal curvatures is referred to as the mean curvature minimal surfaces are considered to have a mean curvature of at any point along the surface therefore a curved surface with a mean curvature of would be a minimal surface with soap films this mean curvature is exactly and this property exists because the tension creates the smallest possible area making the soap film an example of a minimal surface the curvatures of each of the two red dotted lines are the two principal curvatures the mathematician joseph louis lagrange france was the first to propose the concept of a minimal surface in a letter to mathematician leonhard euler switzerland he showed that minimal surfaces satisfy a differential equation called the minimal surface equation plateau s problem remained unsolved for many years until mathematicians jesse douglas usa and tibor rad hungary succeeded independently in solving plateau s problem around douglas went on to receive the first fields medal for his efforts however the approaches by douglas and rad were unable to solve plateau s problem with regard to soap films soap films can have a set sometimes referred to as a singularity set that is difficult to grasp using their methods the approaches by douglas and rad also had strong dimensional restrictions making them impractical for plateau s problem in general dimensions when the frame of a triangular wire pyramid is dipped in soapy water to create a soap film four lines are formed where the soap films meet each other from each apex to the center a collection of such points is referred to as a singularity set geometric measure theory published in by federer who established the foundations for the theory a large publication of about pages it became a milestone in the field and continues to have impact on subsequent research then in the s mathematicians herbert federer usa and wendell fleming usa established a powerful approach for solving the problems related to singularity sets and dimensions with plateau s problem they published a paper on this in it was the first influential result from studying minimal surfaces using geometric measure theory this spurred research on geometrical measure theory starting from the s and it continues to be active today i first encountered geometric measure theory in one of my doctoral classes when i was a graduate student at new york university geometric measure theory published in by federer who established the foundations for the theory a large publication of about pages it became a milestone in the field and continues to have impact on subsequent research it has become well known in recent years that research on minimal surfaces which began with plateau s problem is deeply connected to various phenomena related to interfacial tension including self organization problems where molecules naturally form crystals and polymers and the event horizons of black holes it took over years to establish a theory connecting geometric measure theory and mean curvature flow after graduate school tonegawa became a faculty member at rice university in texas in he attended an intensive course by renowned mathematician lawrence c evans usa at uc berkeley and was fascinated by its contents it was about mean curvature flow and tonegawa is still conducting research on this topic today mean curvature flow is a kind of geometric time evolution problem which is a new field of mathematics that started in the s it is deeply connected with geometric measure theory and basically it involves thinking mathematically about the process from a curved surface state to a minimal surface state i became so interested in the novel approach of moving a curved surface in relation to a minimal surface to solve a problem which people have been studying for years mean curvature flow was first proposed by material scientist william mullins usa in a paper in metal processing there is a process called annealing in the process of slowly cooling heated metal countless fine metal particles called crystal grains are deposited during the cooling process surface tension acts on the surface of the crystal grains causing the surface area of the crystal grains to become as small as possible it is believed that this movement is described by mean curvature flow for a curve this is also simply called the curvature flow video on curvature flow it shows the process of shapes going from a certain state to the minimum state phase changes that occur along the way can be seen a singularity occurs with the mean curvature flow where the area gradually decreases such as the curved surface being cut off in the middle or the curved surface itself disappearing the motion of a surface by its mean curvature published by brakke in although it contained innovative ideas about mean curvature flow using geometric measure theory it did not lead to the establishment of a mathematical theory kenneth brakke usa of princeton university was the first researcher to focus on mean curvature flow under the guidance of fred almgren usa an authority on geometric measure theory like federer brakke published a book on mean curvature flow in based on his dissertation work although it was still the early days of research on mean curvature flow his book was innovative however there were many unclear technical points and no one completely understood its contents the motion of a surface by its mean curvature published by brakke in although it contained innovative ideas about mean curvature flow using geometric measure theory it did not lead to the establishment of a mathematical theory i learned about this in an intensive course by evans in and i began doing research with the goal of developing a proper theory for mean curvature flow however brakke s book was perplexing and difficult to understand after a few wrong turns i started doing research on more generalized problems related to mean curvature flow but in i concluded that such generalized mean curvature flow will not work if you follow brakke s proof as soon as i realized this i had an idea about how i could prove a more straightforward approach it was strange and it came to me in the middle of the night while i battled a fever i decided to start brakke s book all over again brakke s book focuses on an existence theorem and a regularity theorem existence theorems involve proving that a solution to a given problem is theoretically possible in addition to such existence theorems it is necessary to consider what kind of property the created solution should have and since it is a curved surface in this case whether the moving curved surface is smooth or not this is known as a regularity theorem in mathematics you have to prove each and every proposition from the beginning and there can be no gaps it required much patience and time but after about six months of intense focus i was able to complete the proof for the regularity theorem related to brakke s claimed mean curvature flow that was around it still took a while before it was published in ref next i started work on the existence theorem and completed the proof between and and it was published in ref the existence theorem shows how the mean curvature flow which was shown in the previous video can be constructed with mathematical rigor that was about years after my first encounter with brakke s book these achievements were highly regarded and being an expert in the field tonegawa began receiving requests to give lectures from all over the world the problem of how curved surfaces move over time is related to many different engineering problems and could for example help with analyzing combustion surfaces in engine turbines tonegawa looks forward to further advances by the next generations of researchers regarding future research he stated there will always be problems that need to be solved and there are still many basic problems related to mean curvature flow one is analysis of moving singularity sets we have only just reached the starting line more and more questions will surely pop up in the future intensive course given by tonegawa at the fourier institute in france in june the number of people studying mean curvature flow is still few so i want attract more young researchers to the field he also held intensive courses at the international centre for theoretical physics in italy in june and at the hausdorff research institute for mathematics in germany in january his goals were shaped in america moving him to become a mathematician looking back on how he became a mathematician tonegawa added the following i ve been in love with math and mathematics since i was a kid but i wasn t sure that i could make a living as a mathematician when i was a college exchange student in the united states i was in a serious car accident that was a lifechanging experience at that time i decided to live the life i want because we don t know when we will die i chose to follow the path of a mathematician tonegawa reiterated the appeal of mathematics saying in modern society science and technology are advancing extremely rapidly and trends change quickly on the other hand mathematics has a year history and the achievements of many mathematicians have been gradually accumulating up until today major discoveries are rare in mathematics but that means that once a theory is established it is solid and universal also in mathematics it is not enough just to be correct there is a beauty and profoundness similar to that of art and music i feel that these are the main attractions of mathematics looking back on his life in research tonegawa shared the following message for students and early career researchers right now covid is still making it difficult to travel however after things calm down i strongly recommend studying abroad our thinking easily becomes stiff when we continue living in a comfortable and familiar environment you can only have life changing experiences while you are young in my case studying abroad at university had a decisive impact on my future i want you to experience studying abroad before deciding on your career to widen your perspective i recommend that you focus on studying english in addition to your specialized field if you can communicate in english your world will expand dramatically fields medal an international

masao takeyama at the atomic level innovating metallic materials to withstand high temperatures and pressures faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue masao takeyama professor department of materials science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology at the school of materials and chemical technology professor masao takeyama studies the microstructure of metals for use under high temperatures and pressures as well as mechanisms for increasing their performance iron is an abundant resource that is inexpensive and has played a key role in human civilization takeyama enthusiastically stated iron is a gift from god to humankind he continued iron is an amazing substance with many unusual features unlike ordinary metals as the temperature increases the crystal structure changes from a body centered cubic bcc crystal called ferrite to a denser face centered cubic fcc crystal called austenite by utilizing this change in crystal structure phase transformation it s possible to induce different properties this makes it a very attractive material because it can be used in various applications including infrastructure iron still has much potential takeyama is working to uncover such untapped potential in metals particularly in iron and the possibility of its use as a high temperature material body centered cubic bcc structure of ferrite left and face centered cubic fcc structure of austenite right helping to reduce co emissions by improving the performance of metals and alloys takeyama s research is founded upon the phase diagram based microstructure design principle it is a principle for controlling the microstructure of metals requiring high heat resistance and strength at the atomic level in extremely harsh environments such as at power plants and in aircraft engines there is a widespread belief that the thermal power generation sector which uses fossil fuels and accounts for about of japan s co emissions should move toward carbon neutrality but wind power and solar power alone are not enough to cover japan s total annual electricity usage approximately trillion kwh it is the responsibility of researchers to have discussions based on accurate data rather than ideals in consideration of a stable energy supply i think that fuels will change to carbon free fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia but these are still thermal power it is believed that thermal power generation will play an important role in the future and if that happens metallic materials that can be used in harsh environments at increasingly high temperatures and pressures will be needed my goal is to find the principles that can serve as the basis for the design and development of heat resistant materials so it will definitely help to realize a carbon free society japan s research on heat resistant materials is the most advanced in the world accelerating this research and preparing properly as we move toward a carbon free society is key microstructure design determines material properties as a researcher i first want to understand the principles of metals then based on scientific principles i can suggest to the industry this is a good way to improve the performance of a metal in this way i hope to support innovation through industry academia collaboration and contribute from a materials standpoint to resolving the energy and environmental problems facing the world i think that is my role hexagon of disciplines for design principle takeyama s research is based on the idea that properties are determined by the microstructure design he first tries to understand the required properties and then designs the microstructure at the atomic level many people think that the properties of metals and alloys are determined by the composition of the alloys however even if the composition remains the same the performance changes drastically when the microstructure is changed that is the real pleasure of material design according to takeyama the equilibrium phase diagram is a guideline for microstructure design a phase diagram of a metal is a map that shows what kind of phases exist when a certain alloy is kept at a certain temperature for an infinite time when designing new high temperature materials phase diagrams are the most important means of achieving the ultimate goal however many existing multi component phase diagrams are not reliable and many systems have not been studied for ones that have not been studied i make them myself through experiments and calculations this is one of the research subjects that not so many researchers want to do because it takes a lot of time and effort according to takeyama materials designed in this way are prototyped analyzed and verified using many experimental instruments in the laboratory using multiple engineering approaches he has created new materials that perform as required analyzing the elements contained in samples alloys controlling the microstructures of a metallic materials in a high temperature environment capability of iron to be used at high temperatures a keyword of takeyama s research is intermetallic compounds an intermetallic compound is a substance that gains new properties when two or more types of metallic elements are bonded first let s consider research on materials used for power plants with thermal power generation there are gas turbines that use liquefied natural gas as fuel and steam turbines that use coal as a heat source the former consists of a compressor that compresses a large amount of intaken air a combustor that burns the compressed air and fuel and a turbine that uses the high temperature high pressure combustion gas to rotate blades and the rotational force of the turbine is used to rotate the generator to produce electricity a jet engine in an aircraft uses this mechanism and the rotational force of the turbine is used for propulsion on the other hand a steam turbine consists of a boiler heat exchanger that converts water into high temperature high pressure steam supercritical state by burning fossil fuel and a turbine that rotates blades using this steam and as with a gas turbine the rotational force is used to generate electricity there is also a highly efficient combined power system where the exhaust heat of a gas turbine is used to rotate a steam turbine and in both cases efficiency improves as the temperature of the heat medium rotating the blades increases principle of gas turbine system principle of steam turbine system the combustion gas temperature of gas turbines reaches at least and nickel ni based superalloys are used for its components for steam turbines the steam temperature is about and the heat exchanger of the boiler the piping that guides the steam to the turbine chamber and members including the turbine chamber are usually made of an iron ferrite based alloy with a bcc structure power generated with a steam temperature of about is called ultra supercritical usc power generation and the world s highest power generation efficiency is achieved using japan s material technologies however in recent years to reduce co gas emissions and maintain a stable energy supply development of advanced ultra supercritical a usc power plants has been promoted in japan europe and the united states where the steam temperature for thermal power generation is raised to or higher in order to further improve power generation efficiency normal ferrite based alloys where use is limit to about cannot be used for these in other words new high strength heat resistant metallic materials need to be developed for such a usc plants since such power plants operate continuously every day the material must not fail even when exposed to high temperatures for hours years or more while experiencing a stress of mpa at the operating temperature this means the material must have excellent creep strength creep is a phenomenon in which strain increases over time when stress is applied continuously to an object at high temperature normally at such temperatures ni based alloys that have a proven track record as jet engine materials are the candidate materials the goal of takeyama s research is to realize materials made from iron based alloys that excel in both heat resistance and creep rupture strength it is a dream to have an iron based alloy with a creep rupture strength of mpa or more for hours at normally only ni based alloys are considered however nickel is an expensive rare metal the price is about times higher than that of iron and it s increasing our goal was to see how high of a temperature we can achieve with iron this is extremely ambitious and challenging we have worked on achieving this by using iron based alloys which is an abundant resource and is inexpensive says takeyama questioning the common belief that intermetallic compounds cannot be used takeyama s attempt was successful what makes iron interesting is that the crystal structure changes greatly depending on the temperature and the type and amount of elements that are added takeyama was focusing on the crystal structure of iron at high temperatures iron has the same fcc structure austenite as ni based alloys at high temperatures various heat resistant materials based on austenite have already been developed but their heat resistance performance is low because carbides compounds of carbon and metal elements are used for the strengthening phase however ni based alloys have excellent heat resistance because thermodynamically stable intermetallic compounds are used for the strengthening phase that is why the creep strength of austenite is inferior to that of ni based alloys even though they have the same fcc structure if an intermetallic compound is used for the strengthening phase and the grain boundaries which becomes a weakening factor at high temperatures are covered with the intermetallic compound phases and the heat resistance can be increased to or higher according to takeyama i had a nagging question for many years as to why there are no austenitic heat resistant materials that use intermetallic compounds in the strengthening phase he recalled therefore takeyama asked many different people why there are no austenitic heat resistant materials that use intermetallic compounds he found that while it is was assumed that intermetallic compounds are hard and brittle and cannot be used no one had actually tried to use them the compounds have been intentionally avoided for designing alloys it is important to question common beliefs i carefully examined the ternary phase diagram of fe ni m m is a transition metal element experimentally determined fe ni nb ternary phase diagram calculated fe ni nb ternary phase diagram based on this i was able to identify a region where an fe m type intermetallic compound phase consisting of two iron atoms and one m element called a laves phase exists laves phases had been found in materials that ruptured when exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time so this phase was considered to be harmful therefore materials have been designed to avoid formation of laves phases however there is no consideration of time axis in the thought laves phases are stable phases that form after a long period of time at high temperature the cause of the deterioration is actually not the laves phases but the microstructural change and instability of the carbide that was first used for the strengthening phase which changes to an intermetallic compound over time therefore i believed that if laves phases were used for the strengthening phase from the beginning it would be an effective strengthening phase for improving high temperature creep strength takeyama began researching austenitic heat resistant materials that utilize laves phases first he established guiding principles for microstructure design for that purpose and devised a new strengthening method called grain boundary precipitation strengthening gbps in this mechanism the grain boundaries which are the interfaces between crystal grains are decorated with laves phases and the higher the degree of decoration called area fraction the higher the creep strength crystal structure of laves phase grain boundary precipitation strengthening mechanism as he expected the iron based alloy takeyama designed was found to have a creep strength comparable to that of nickel based alloys he succeeded in demonstrating that even fe based alloys can obtain creep strength comparable to that of ni based alloys the idea of gbps actually dates back to when i was a graduate student in my dissertation i investigated the relationship between grain boundary coverage and creep strength due to precipitates i noticed that the higher the grain boundary coverage between the grains the higher the creep strength looking to titanium aluminide base alloys to reduce aircraft weight establishing the world s first guiding principles for microstructure design takeyama also designs intermetallic materials for aircraft engines the structure of a jet engine is basically the same as that of a gas turbine for power generation used on the ground but the decisive difference is that since it is a flying object weight must be minimized to improve fuel efficiency it is important to increase the compression ratio of the air taken in and to use the energy from combustion as effectively as possible the temperature of the compressed air is about but recently there has been a demand for stronger materials that can withstand with a higher compression ratio a turbine is divided into two parts a high pressure turbines hpt into which combustion gas is blown at or higher and low pressure turbines lpt which further utilize this gas to generate power until now ni based alloys have been used for the compressor blades and lpt blades of jet engines however to improve fuel efficiency materials that are lighter and with higher strength are needed takeyama is studying titanium aluminide tial based alloys as such a material titanium aluminide has a specific gravity that is about half that of nickel and has excellent high temperature strength and oxidation resistance as an intermetallic compound material it is attracting the most attention as a material for moving blades lpt blades manufactured with the tial based alloys through casting have been installed in boeing engines since and it took about years to put these into practical use in order to put a new material into practical use as an engine material which can impact human life it must pass various safety performance tests from the manufacturing process to the strength in lpt blades formed by forging were installed in airbus a neo engines forged materials have better fracture toughness compared to cast materials i established the world s first guiding principles for microstructure design through this forging process researchers and companies in europe quickly adopted this takeyama explained the approach for establishing these design guidance principles is the same as for the fe based alloys development strengthened by laves phase as mentioned above first i made a ternary phase diagram of ti al m m is a transition metal element where another element is added to the ti and al there was no information for the ternary phase diagrams at that time so we made it ourselves we focused on the equilibrium phases at high temperature with the tial phase called the phase which is the basis of the alloy from this we found a ti al phase called phase and ti phase with a bcc structure called phase as equilibrium phases with the phase there are regions where these three phases coexist and the composition of the coexisting region greatly depends on the temperature from this we found a unique phase transformation that does not exist in the ti al binary system using this phase transformation a forging process became possible which was believed to be impossible until then i established microstructure and process design principles for wrought tial based alloys with high strength and high toughness this research report was made in the latter half of the s i believe but at that time no one understood it and it received little attention at that time casting was mainstream and it was believed that forging brittle intermetallic compounds was impossible however some people took notice these were european universities and companies which led to its practical application says takeyama takeyama demonstrated that the microstructure determines the characteristics in his research on titanium aluminide and he clarified the mechanism for increasing the strength to further improve the characteristics he has recently been working on four dimensional microstructure analysis that incorporates a time axis into the three dimensional analysis here the surface of a metal material was thinly sliced every nm and photographed and this was repeated times or more these images were then integrated into a three dimensional image of the tial based alloy it was found that the white phase which only looked like particles in the two dimensional image actually had an elongated plate like shape which is what helps improve strength and toughness some of takeyama s research on iron based alloys was conducted under the japan science and technology agency s jst advanced low carbon technology research and development program alca and research on titanium aluminide was conducted with support from the cabinet office s cross ministerial strategic innovation promotion program sip structural materials for innovation with takeyama taking the lead on research for these projects this achievement was highly regarded and takeyama received the academic achievement award from the iron and steel institute of japan in and the honda memorial lecture award from the japan institute of metals and materials in continuity is the father of success and do not be deterred by common beliefs and prejudices takeyama first decided to be a metallurgist when he was in high school in high school i once asked my father who was a professor at hokkaido university researching metal materials what he was researching he said why iron becomes harder when carbon is added i then asked is that research interesting he answered it s very interesting that is why i decided to follow the same path takeyama has the following message to young people considering careers in research be full of curiosity have questions make effort and be humble i ve been researching titanium aluminide for years i ve probably studied this material longer than anyone in the world i think perseverance is power i hope that you will pursue themes that you really find interesting and not just themes that make it easy to secure funding or to write papers according to trends also do not be deterred by common beliefs or prejudices instead of just accepting what is written in newspapers and textbooks or what a teacher says as true you should ask is that really true never stop being curious and wanting to make sure for yourself phase transformation phase refers to the state of matter such as gas liquid or solid phase transformation refers to a change in the crystal structure of a material as a simple example water liquid phase turns into ice solid phase below and vapor gas phase at there are also solid phase transformations iron is a bcc structured iron phase at low temperature to but undergoes a phase transformation to fcc structured iron phase at to iron based alloy an alloy containing at least iron is called an iron based alloy similarly with nickel it is called a nickel based alloy and with titanium aluminide it is called a titanium aluminide based alloy laves phase phases of intermetallic compounds with high electrical conductivity but that are characterized by extremely low plasticity and ductility which are a characteristic of metals precipitate a product material where an excessively dissolved atom is separated from a parent crystal and is newly formed casting a processing method in which a material is heated to a temperature higher than the melting point to make it a liquid and it is then poured into a mold to be cooled and hardened forging a processing method that increases strength by hammering the metal and applying pressure to form it into a desired shape masao takeyama professor school of materials and chemical technology

manabu ihara creating an ambient energy society fighting global warming and growing the economy can go together faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor manabu ihara professor department of chemical science and engineering school of materials and chemical technology director tokyo tech academy of energy and informatics on october prime minister yoshihide suga declared in a policy speech that japan would reduce its overall emissions of co and other greenhouse gases to zero by he stated that dealing with global warming is no longer a constraint on economic growth taking aggressive measures to fight global warming will bring about changes in industry and the economy leading to significant growth working towards this very goal is manabu ihara professor at the school of materials and chemical technology and an expert in environment and energy research representing more than environment and energy researchers at tokyo tech ihara launched the infosyenergy consortium in november to promote research and education spanning big data science and energy the goal is to create a sustainable energy society that brings together global warming countermeasures and economic revitalization what ihara envisions as an ambient energy society preventing energy waste through ai and big data analysis in power generation and power consumption ihara is excited about prime minister suga s declaration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to virtually zero it s a welcome goal the transition to a sustainable energy system will be further accelerated universities have a large role to play and it s also a great business opportunity for companies we will take on this challenge in the framework of industry academia collaboration the environmental energy innovation building is covered with solar panels its smart energy system ene swallow enables efficient operation of distributed power supply and a unique power prediction model based on real time data is used to perform peak cut control tokyo tech s ookayama campus has a unique building visible from the tokyu oimachi line and covered with solar panels named the environmental energy innovation building eei it was completed in and serves as a research building using renewable energy technologies such as its large scale solar cell installation as well as the integration of fuel cells gas engines li ion batteries and other storage systems the eei is mostly energy self sufficient it also employs a smart energy system called ene swallow that collects and analyzes all data related to the building s power generation and consumption this has enabled more efficient energy use reducing co emissions by more than compared to other research buildings of the same size it was ihara who worked on the development of this system the environmental energy innovation building is covered with solar panels its smart energy system ene swallow enables efficient operation of distributed power supply and a unique power prediction model based on real time data is used to perform peak cut control ihara is currently working on the following three research topics next generation solar cells water electrolysis cells for hydrogen production as well as hydrogen powered fuel cells and a new smart energy system for controlling various energy devices in an integrated manner in the development of next generation solar cells a tandem structure consisting of a perovskite solar cell and a silicon solar cell is being used with the aim of improving energy conversion efficiency by over this exceeds the maximum conversion efficiency of current silicon solar modules in addition the adoption of renewable energy is essential for reducing co emissions achieving that however requires the technology to store and transport the energy that has been generated therefore ihara is focusing on the development of technology for the utilization of hydrogen energy as his second research topic hydrogen is the optimal substance for storing a large amount of energy over a long period of time moreover converting electrical energy into hydrogen makes it possible to transport energy from the production site to the point of consumption water electrolysis cells can be used to produce hydrogen from electrical energy and fuel cells allow for highly efficient conversion of hydrogen to electrical energy but for society to adopt these technologies costs need to be reduced through further improvements in efficiency at my laboratory we are developing solid oxides electrodes electrolytes and unique operation methods that function at higher temperatures and have faster ion conductivities and reaction rates in doing so we are aiming for a comprehensive reduction in manufacturing and power generation costs for his third research topic of a new smart energy system ihara is developing a grid cooperative distributed real time smart energy system as the next evolution of ene swallow he is aiming for completion in five years in cooperation with faculty members and companies of the infosy energy consortium described later with ene swallow the eei currently acquires about data points in one second to one minute the next generation ene swallow will be implemented not only for the eei but also the entire ookayama campus allowing fuel cells electric vehicles and other various energy devices to connect to it and acquire data the idea is to analyze that big data with ai to achieve highly precise device control and accurate forecasting of electricity demand ihara states that in order to expand adoption of renewable energy it is essential to provide the electricity market with reliable power that can adjust to fluctuations associated with renewable energy production he further plans to construct an energy data informatic platform for common use renewables for the next generation of energy systems a challenge undertaken by researchers across academia industry and the world energy systems are directly linked to industry and civil life in designing a next generation energy system we should specify what kind of society we should aim for what steps we should take to achieve it and what challenges we must overcome in the future then we must share this widely with the rest of society furthermore realizing an ambient energy society one in which fighting global warming and growing the economy are both possible is not something achievable by a single university company or country it is important to build strong global partnerships between academic research and industrial institutions therefore in november the infosy energy consortium was launched at tokyo tech with ihara playing a central role currently participating in the consortium are more than tokyo tech professors associate professors from various energy related fields as well as universities and more than companies and other institutions from around the world including students the consortium s approximately members are working on nine research topics an energy society combining low carbon large scale power sources and distributed systems energy systems have been designed to send electricity generated at a centralized power plant to local regions through power transmission lines but moving forward the number of distributed systems with local production and local consumption will increase in local regions where electricity is generated and consumed using renewable energy networking distributed energy with information and communication technology ict makes it function like a single power plant furthermore utilizing the free energy market achieved through networked regions energy lending can occur providing stability for the system in this future system in addition to data on where and how much electricity is produced and used data on the movement of people and automobiles is also collected and analyzed using ai this will optimize supply and demand on the premise of buying and selling in the energy market benefiting both the economy and the environment towards social implementation ookayama campus will be a proof of concept region for us to conduct research and development these days in other countries where large amounts of renewable energy are generated limits are placed on base load power sources controlling power in the same way in japan can achieve the economic rationality of electric power as a whole and the reduction of co emissions a power source that can supply a certain amount of stable electricity at a low cost regardless of season weather day or night we are working on technologies for improving the conversion efficiency of solar cells and the development of hydrogen production technology using photocatalysts we are developing technology for production of hydrogen via water electrolysis utilization of produced hydrogen in fuel cells and storage batteries for storing surplus power the next generation energy system is expected to adopt global hydrogen and local hydrogen global hydrogen is hydrogen produced in large amounts using cheap electricity in areas with long daylight hours such as the middle east and australia and transported using that hydrogen as fuel a turbine at a power plant is turned to produce large amounts of co free electricity local hydrogen is hydrogen produced from renewable energy within a small electric energy network in japan and used in fuel cells etc electricity is currently bought and sold only in units of kilowatt hour kwh for the value of the electric energy but diversification is expected in the near future such as in the value of electricity during times when less power is generated the value of adaptability to sudden changes in power and the value of low carbon electricity therefore we are designing a next generation electricity free market global hydrogen involves transporting a large amount of hydrogen from overseas therefore converting liquid hydrogen or hydrogen into ammonia nh or methylcyclohexane mch etc so that it can be easily transported is under consideration we are conducting research here on catalysts that are essential for this purpose the heat generated by burning coal and natural gas currently produces steam which turns a turbine to generate electricity however with the goal of reducing co emissions a shift to mixed firing which mixes hydrogen with natural gas and to single fuel firing which uses only hydrogen is expected therefore we are developing technology and designing systems for the stable combustion of hydrogen and for the effective use of heat universities have the important role of working on future technologies and fundamental research for which there is not always a prospect of social implementation in the next years based on these research efforts we believe that research resulting in social implementation will emerge in the future in addition to energy science and engineering and information science researchers from a wide range of fields such as sociology and economics will gather to discuss what the energy society should be like and propose disseminate scenarios for bringing it about ihara advocates an ambient energy society as the future society that the consortium should aim for this is defined as a human centered energy society freed from constraints on energy use such as energy costs and co emissions by wisely using mainly renewable energy with iot ict and ai analysis of big data and creating diverse services in other words a society in which energy can be used naturally ambient without feeling overconscious about energy consumption in creating a next generation energy society co emission reductions and economic growth must be able to coexist through system optimizations with various scales multi scale energy optimization technology via ai driven big data analysis and wide use high accuracy prediction for energy management knowledge structured ai hybrid energy prediction the electricity market can be provided with stable and flexible power promoting a bottom up shift to an autonomous decentralized and collaborative energy society furthermore if innovative services are created based on the collected data new value could be expected from business opportunities for converting energy systems for example if you can calculate the route with the lowest energy cost when delivering express home delivery packages that data becomes a business in other words it is no exaggeration to say that data for optimizing energy use holds promise in terms of energy conservation but is also a major business opportunity it will take some time before we can realize such a society but i strongly believe that we can reach that goal this is the true definition of sustainability and that is why now is the time for researchers and engineers to give it their all developing multi scoped talent to lead the energy society the academy of energy and informatics aims to develop multi scoped phd talent ihara has a message for the young people who will define the future after completing my doctoral degree i became an assistant professor in the division of global environmental engineering this sparked my interest in and brought home the importance of research on energy conversion in particular to limit global warming i decided to make it a lifelong research topic that i would work on the world was skeptical of global warming at the time but i believed in my own inquiries and intuition therefore i would like young people who will define the future to be courageous enough to aim for research that will open up new research fields progress in research that creates new fields requires logical inquiry and passion based on scientific principles i hope that young aspiring researchers in particular will find a research topic they think is really fun and necessary as well as learn the scientific principles manabu ihara professor department of chemical science and engineering school

kei sakaguchi development and standardization of g keys to putting automated driving cars on the road faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor kei sakaguchi professor department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering dean of the tokyo tech academy for super smart society in full scale commercial service is launching for the new wireless communication standard known as g th generation mobile communication systems kei sakaguchi a professor in the department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering and dean of the tokyo tech academy for super smart society proposed technology that forms the basis of g and worked on its international standardization currently sakaguchi is working to create a g driven super smart society mobile data volume is doubling annually introducing new frequencies and communication standards in january the smartphone era began with the release of the apple iphone after that snss such as youtube and instagram began to spread and everyone began downloading and uploading large amounts of data using their smartphones and other mobile devices that has rapidly increased the data traffic volume that mobile devices send via base stations doubling it annually if this situation continues it s easy to predict an increase by a factor of about in years in order to address this situation i thought we need to immediately work on introducing new frequencies and communication standards that s what motivated sakaguchi to start on g research he proposed using millimeter wave mmwave for new radio wave frequencies resolving the trade off between high speed communication and connectivity was the year when commercial service was launched for th generation g which is currently commonplace g mainly uses frequencies of ghz or lower on the other hand raising the frequency and using a wider bandwidth enables higher speeds and high capacity communication therefore everyone realized that higher speeds and high capacity can be achieved using mmwave which use a much higher frequency than ghz however raising the frequency is not easy this is because of the trade off between frequency and the distance radio waves can reach connectivity if the frequency is set higher the radio waves do not reach far enough and communication will be prone to interruptions for that reason g focused on connectivity rather than high speed and high capacity using lower frequencies to avoid communication interruptions however there were limits to the continued use of low frequencies so i searched for a way to overcome the trade off of using radio waves then one day in i suddenly came up with the idea to just use both sakaguchi both means that low frequencies are used for control signals where connectivity is important and high frequencies like mmwave are used for data signals where high speed and high capacity are important that convinced sakaguchi that both connectivity and high speed high capacity communication could be achieved in fact in japan there was a time when r d of communication systems using mmwave was being promoted nationally however development proved very difficult and with no prospect of commercialization the great recession struck in many of the research institutions participating in the project were forced to withdraw the mmwave research that we had cultivated over so many years was going to be wasted so i was determined to bring mmwave into practical use sakaguchi adapted from principal uses and characteristics of radio wave telecommunications bureau of the ministry of internal affairs and communications website applications by radio frequency band mmwave g becomes an international standard in many mobile operators were concerned that the traffic volume would increase by a factor of about in years but g had just begun so the focus was on improving the performance of g they were not yet serious about the development of g therefore i carved out a path for mmwave by calculating how much we could increase the total traffic volume that mobile communication systems can handle showing the concrete calculations made clear the need for mmwave g sakaguchi against this backdrop in september tokyo was selected as the site of the olympic games since the tokyo olympics is a great opportunity to showcase new applications enabled by g was chosen as g year one that same winter in addition semiconductor makers such as intel showed a strong interest in sakaguchi s idea since international standardization is essential for mobile communications with the support of intel and others sakaguchi started to work toward the international standardization of mmwave g in that led them in to set out to issue a new report that opened the door to mmwave g at the international telecommunication union radiocommunication sector itu r then in order to realize his idea sakaguchi developed a method of superimposing a large number of mmwave base stations with small coverage on microwave base station coverage this method is called a heterogeneous network compared to g it provided about times higher speed and capacity lower latency and times more simultaneous connections a heterogeneous network superimposes a large number of mmwave base stations with small coverage on microwave base station coverage microwaves are used for control signals where connectivity is important and mmwaves are used for data signals where high speed and high capacity are important achieving both connectivity and high speed high capacity in response to this achievement in april the ministry of internal affairs and communications allocated mmwave in the ghz frequency band to four domestic mobile operators as the first phase of g thus in full scale g commercial service has started in addition the ministry of internal affairs and communications has also assigned mmwave for g used in private spaces such as stadiums factories and schools under the name local g this is expected to accelerate the spread of g in one fell swoop g is essential for realizing automated driving cars what are the safety requirements what kind of future society will be created with the spread of g when mmwave was selected as a g candidate at itu r in the first killer application i thought of was its application to automated driving cars sakaguchi at the time sakaguchi was enrolled at the fraunhofer society in germany the largest applied research institute in europe he proposed a project to apply g to automated driving and succeeded in obtaining a budget along with this a project on the international standardization of wireless communication that utilizes mmwave g for automated driving was started sakaguchi said that its application to automated driving first required us to quantitatively show why ultra high speed high capacity wireless communication is necessary for automated driving cars normally there are speed limits on roads and it is necessary to keep an adequate inter vehicle distance between cars that is in order to ensure safety the driver needs to detect objects whose distance is equal to or greater than the braking distance which is the distance traveled from when the brake pedal is pressed to when the braking is stopped based on visual information this means that driving safety can be improved by obtaining a large volume of data at low latency there was no theory to date that correlates data volume with safety so we created a new theory for the first time anywhere we showed theoretically how much data is required to ensure safety and that g is essential for automated driving sakaguchi currently sakaguchi is working on v x research aimed at the commercialization of safe automated vehicles v x is an abbreviation for vehicle to everything which is communication from cars to all sorts of things such as car to car and car to network with v x in the near future cars will be able to wirelessly communicate with nearby cars various devices installed on the road pedestrian mobile devices etc without the need for intervention by the driver this will enhance the safety of automated driving research on v x vehicle to everything for the realization of automated driving v x will allow for communication from car to car car to network and other linkages the higher the speed the more data you need for automated driving therefore it will first be put to practical use in vehicles that run at low speeds such as tractors in addition this can also eventually be applied to drones robots cities societies etc we call this kind of future a super smart society enabled by g sakaguchi components that enable automated driving include various sensors such as cameras installed in vehicles a database map containing map data of the surroundings edge computing for driving from sensor data and map data mec decision server and artificial intelligence ai that collects information from multiple vehicles and analyzes big data the vehicle is controlled by transmitting and receiving data between these components via g at ultra high speed and low latency when humans drive humans can only control the vehicle but with automated driving cars it is also possible for neighboring vehicles to work together on control in addition to vehicles sakaguchi is aiming to expand the actuators applications to drones robots cities and societies is life trapped on a tiny smartphone screen real happiness potential examples of the super smart society include smart mobility through automated driving smart agriculture smart factories where multiple robots make things together and smart medical care where automated medical and nursing care robots play an active role with g we have arrived at a special point in wireless communication technology by being able to handle high frequency radio waves we believe that this will be applied to g and beyond however i think that its uses are still developing for example if a person from the edo period were to see a modern person looking at a smartphone screen on a train they would surely feel sorry for them in the long history of humankind the current situation of being trapped on the tiny screen of a smartphone is by no means happiness my research is to think about what things should look like how to change society and then to create this vision sakaguchi part of that effort includes g ar augmented reality glasses ar glasses by sakaguchi for use in research and development by wearing the glasses virtual information is superimposed on the real world you currently get search information on the screen of your smartphone but i d like to eventually eliminate that kind of thing for example the goal is that the first time a person comes to tokyo tech when they stand at the entrance of the campus the ar glasses will automatically display the campus map of tokyo tech and directions to destinations sakaguchi the important part of these information devices is the platform that supports services therefore sakaguchi is currently researching how to build a platform that can provide inexpensive and easy to use services you often see statements like we increased efficiency by but i m not interested in small improvements my primary concern is how to use wireless communication technology to solve the ultimate problems that society faces i always conduct research with that in mind for example natural disasters such as floods have become more serious in recent years in response we are thinking of making the house itself an autonomous vehicle and letting the whole house evacuate in the event of a flood sakaguchi human resources that will enable the future the reason why sakaguchi became a wireless communication researcher dates back to high school i was playing music in a band and the wires were troublesome so i wondered if i could make everything wireless in fact as a researcher i think that research is as much art as music cooking or sports only through constant practice and trial and error can you produce excellent results and impress people there is no shortcut to success other than steady daily efforts sakaguchi in addition sakaguchi serves as the dean of tokyo tech academy for super smart society started in april to develop human resources that will serve as the driving force of the super smart society at the tokyo tech academy for super smart society the smart mobility research and education field provides opportunities such as testing automated driving cars on campus to gain an overall view of technology for realizing automated driving sakaguchi encourages young people who are entrusted with the future the future that wireless communication technology will enable is still to come so you can follow your ideas wherever they take you not relying on common knowledge or cheap tech tricks and not yielding to the people around you i hope that you will pioneer the future with ideas that you believe in kei sakaguchi profile school of engineering creating new industries and advancing civilization information on school of engineering inaugurated in april school of engineering

shuichiro hirai lithium ion batteries are full of mystery using real time visualization to improve battery performance faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor shuichiro hirai department of mechanical engineering school of engineering annual co emissions in japan total about billion tons in liquid form this is enough to fill tokyo domes to reduce co emissions japan is currently promoting the development and use of electric vehicles evs and fuel cell vehicles fcvs increasing the prevalence of evs however requires improved performance professor shuichiro hirai has been working toward this goal through development of real time visualization technology for a wide range of battery cells installed on evs and fcvs real time visualization is essential to improving battery performance evs today principally employ lithium ion batteries akira yoshino an honorary fellow with asahi kasei corporation and two others were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for the development of the lithium ion battery although lithium ion batteries have found broad application around the world much of their underlying mechanisms remain unclear take for example the power indicator on a smartphone after charging the icon will initially show a full charge but if you wait a short while the indicator will suddenly drop hirai explains battery power usually decreases gradually so it is very strange that the remaining power suddenly drops this illustrates that we are not yet able to make sensors that can accurately measure remaining battery power not yet understanding what occurs in lithium ion batteries makes them a black box to us in addition fcvs have as the name implies fuel cells onboard fuel cells extract electrical energy generated from a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the air because fcvs only emit water they are an outstanding candidate for next generation green automobiles with expectations for broad adoption however there are many things about fuel cells that are still not understood hirai says to improve battery performance it is necessary to visualize in real time and at the micrometer level what is happening inside batteries our laboratory is working to improve battery performance through research and development of visualization devices and technology that can only be found here shuichiro hirai s fields of research his wide range of research includes lithium ion and all solid state batteries for evs lithium air batteries fuel cells for fcvs and adsorption heat pumps his goal is to reduce co emissions through broad adoption of these technologies contributing to the improvement of all solid state battery performance using x rays to visualize the interior of all solid state batteries and distinguish between electrode material solid electrolyte material and voids hirai is now working on visualization of all solid state lithium ion batteries all solid state batteries instead of conventional liquid electrolytes all solid state batteries employ solid electrolytes which reduce the risk of fire and enable quick recharge development towards practical application has been actively pursued both domestically and abroad because the material used is solid however lithium ion mobility is not as readily achieved as with liquid this prompted me to try using an x ray ct unit to image the interior of the all solid state battery under development by our own ryoji kanno a frontrunner in the field says hirai extremely small voids running vertically horizontally and diagonally exist in electrodes and solid electrolytes and these interfere with the mobility of lithium ions we must reduce these voids as much as possible to allow lithium ions to move at high speeds hirai however sought to identify the optimum void size through real time visualization to do so he applied pressure to the electrode and solid electrolyte materials to observe the interior of the battery using x rays it was necessary to distinguish between electrode material solid electrolyte material and void space distinguishing between the electrolyte material and void space was quite difficult but the staff and students in my lab rose to the challenge and by tuning the apparatus succeeded in achieving high resolution visualization explains hirai this enabled the team to see that many microscale cracks occurred in the materials as a result of the way in which pressure was applied they learned that these cracks limited lithium ion mobility and led to deterioration of performance they also found that controlling pressurization conditions prevented cracks from occurring this breakthrough will certainly contribute to performance improvement and practical application of all solid state batteries states hirai visualizing water behavior in fuel cell batteries cell structure in a fuel cell battery fuel cell batteries contain thin films less than mm thick these films form cells that include a catalytic layer coated with platinum catalyst fuel cells employ catalyst to cause hydrogen passed one side of the cell s thin film to react with oxygen in the air passed on the other side and produce water the energy generated is then converted to electricity the water produced in the reaction remains on the surface of the cells however which hinders the hydrogen oxygen reaction and decreases power generation performance therefore the water being generated needs to be controlled unfortunately the behavior of water produced in this reaction including where in the cell the water is generated and where it moves to were not well understood hirai and the fuel cell cutting edge research center technology research association fc cubic tra jointly developed an x ray ct unit capable of visualizing the behavior of water produced inside fuel cells in real time the development visualizes behavior of water by irradiating cells with x rays and detecting those x rays with a detector x rays used in standard radiography cannot detect water so we tuned the wavelength to maximize sensitivity to water in addition conventional x rays which are emitted radially were adjusted to enable parallel emission and thus detection of water we then introduced hydrogen and oxygen into the visualization unit to observe their behavior under reaction we succeeded for the first time in the world in visualizing water produced inside operating fuel cells at high resolution micrometer level in real time and over an extended period explains hirai change in reaction produced water over time inside a fuel cell during power generation an x ray ct unit was developed capable of visualizing the emergence and behavior of water produced inside fuel cells in real time over an extended period irradiating fuel cells with x rays and detection via a detector made it possible to visualize the behavior of water in the reaction hirai has also been collaborating with the private sector on research and development of adsorption heat pumps this heat pump uses water absorbing silica gel which cools air using the heat of vaporization generated when the silica gel adsorbs water this makes it possible to cool air without using electricity however in order to do so it is necessary to provide heat externally and rapidly vaporize the water adsorbed to the silica gel currently researchers are considering the use of waste heat discharged from plants as a heat source they also needed to clarify the behavior of the water absorbed in the silica gel to identify practical applications hirai s x ray ct unit was key to this research for visualizing the behavior of water in silica gel a small adsorption heat pump installed in an x ray visualization unit x ray visualization analysis of water adsorption and desorption in silica gel particles establishing your own research theme is crucial visualization equipment as well as technology that are suitable for the characteristics of target objects need to be developed as a set rather than independently it is also necessary for us to understand the fundamental principles for batteries in particular the equipment and technology must allow for visualizing the movement and reaction of substances as well as the specific phenomena occurring in this regard i can make full use of my specialties in mechanical engineering thermal engineering and hydromechanics says hirai hirai is seeking to further improve the visualization equipment and technology he also would like to expand the range of application from lithium ion all solid state and fuel cell batteries to lithium air batteries and adsorption heat pumps thereby contributing to the reduction of co emissions at the end of the interview hirai had a message for young people considering a career in research i was in elementary school at the time of the oil crisis since then i have been very interested in energy recently in particular i have contemplated a lot about what constitutes the prowess of a nation although japan lacks energy resources the nation has a capacity in science and technology unrelated to its total area or large population utilizing this ability is the best strategy for continued economic growth and i hope more young people become interested in careers in this area having the scientific curiosity to ask how and why is key rather than wholly accepting classroom knowledge without question we should search deeper for example by asking why the person who first thought of entropy came up with the concept in the first place we can delve into this history from our individual perspectives and i think that process can lead to discovering something important even if we achieve great results our research will not receive recognition if it is not original after completing my master s degree i told the professor of the lab i belonged to that i wanted to do research on a theme that i had set not the theme that the professor had set this was instrumental in my achieving good results the professor always told us not to follow him but to surpass him he was a great researcher and educator many people start with what others before them have done however if you start this method of mimicry you will ultimately hit a dead end if you set your own research theme from the start you will blaze your own trail i tell my students to think differently from the way i do to set their own methods and accept challenges that truly excite them shuichiro hirai profile school of engineering creating new industries and advancing civilization information on school of engineering inaugurated in april school of

shoen kume towards a new therapy for diabetes regenerating pancreas from es and ips cells faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor shoen kume department of life science and technology school of life science and technology a potential new treatment for diabetes is emerging in the form of regenerative medicine the focus is on producing pancreatic cells the cells that secrete insulin in a test tube for later transplant professor shoen kume at the school of life science and technology is working on the generation of cells from embryonic stem es cells and induced pluripotent stem ips cells the process of pancreas development diabetes occurs when a lack of insulin reduces the level of glucose in the blood insulin is a hormone secreted by the endocrine cells in pancreatic islets therefore diabetes is thought to be caused by the dysfunction of cells currently treatment for diabetes involves insulin injection or in severe cases transplant of pancreas or pancreatic islets however lack of donors poses a serious problem the transplantation of cells produced in a lab may offer an alternative kume hopes to make this a reality looking back at the start of her research kume states when i was a doctoral student i was involved in developmental biology which focuses on the development of multicellular organisms and the process of differentiation of the fertilized ovum into organs i was initially interested in the establishment of body axis immediately after fertilization but my experience as a research associate at harvard university shifted my focus to pancreas development kume became interested in the pancreas while studying under a professor at harvard who was hoping to help his two children both of whom have type diabetes taking an interest in pancreas development kume found that still little was known about the process this piqued her curiosity after returning to japan in she began research on pancreas development in earnest at the institute of molecular embryology and genetics at kumamoto university her research there would continue until one possible approach is to identify adult stem cells in pancreas and examine their ability for regeneration although some tissues regenerate daily other tissues do not the pancreas is a tissue that is supposed not to actively regenerate for this reason kume surmised that adult stem cells would not yet be a good choice and decided to instead explore the potential of using es and ips cells stem cell types include embryonic stem es cells induced pluripotent stem ips cells and adult stem cells it was first necessary to investigate which genes potentiate the differentiation into pancreatic cells figure shows the development of pancreas from es or ips cells es ips cells first differentiate into endoderm then into the pancreatic precursor cells pancreatic precursor cells then give rise to the endocrine precursor cells which differentiate into the endocrine islet cells including and other cells figure developmental process of pancreas from es ips cells it is known for example that a gene called pdx marks the pancreatic precursor cells figure kume started investigating pancreatic precursor cells developed from mouse es ips cells using genes such as pdx as a marker specifically kume attempted to establish an es cell line bearing a green fluorescent protein gfp as a reporter to monitor the expression of pdx gene this made it possible to quickly and easily identify differentiation into pancreatic precursor cells kume recalls after repeated trial and error we succeeded in establishing a procedure for efficient production of pancreatic precursor cells from mouse es ips cells i still remember the excitement we felt the moment we saw the cells fluorescing in green video this achievement was widely reported in the media figure induced differentiation from es cells to pancreas figure visualization of the differentiation of cells in a test tube induced differentiation of es cells into pancreatic precursor cells at kume laboratory discovering substances that promote differentiation into cells a potential new treatment for diabetes kume then set out to identify the conditions that promote differentiation of pancreatic precursor cells into cells she explains we knew that adding certain growth factors or low molecular weight compounds promotes cell differentiation however the compounds we already knew might not be enough to regulate the differentiation into cells therefore in collaboration with a professor at kyoto university we began using a library of low molecular weight compounds whose mechanisms of action have already been determined and listed as pharmaceutical agents in markets pharmaceutical agents usually target specific molecules such as enzymes and receptors careful examinations of an agent s mechanism of action give implications on its therapeutic effects the chemical library allowed kume and colleagues to narrow down the molecules that are involved in differentiation into cells figure seeking compounds that promote differentiation and discovering unknown action mechanisms one by one kume added approximately compounds stored in the chemical library to culture media to identify compounds that promote differentiation into cells the results were fascinating she found that a vesicular monoamine transporter vmat inhibitor called tetrabenazine tbz reduces dopamine in cells and promotes differentiation into cells in fact she used tbz and another compound to differentiate mouse es cells into islet cells and transplanted them into diabetic mice she then found that the blood glucose level in the mice improved kume then started investigating conditions that promote the cell mass she found that a dopamine d receptor drd called domperidone dpd inhibits dedifferentiation into cells and maintains their function the intricate role of amino acids in cell differentiation kume also clarified the importance of culture media in developing normal cells while some es ips cell lines differentiate well into a certain direction others do not and any remaining undifferentiated cells may develop into tumors therefore it is essential in regenerative medicine to ensure that no undifferentiated cells remain she explains by removing one of amino acids at a time from culture media we found that the absence of methionine from the mix resulted in the selective elimination of undifferentiated cells prior research using mouse es cells showed that without the amino acid threonine undifferentiated cells died here we used human es cells and found that methionine is essential the method developed at kume s lab promoted differentiation of es ips cells after culturing in methionine deprived media for a few hours eliminated only undifferentiated cells and resulted in promoted differentiation experimenting with different culture media showed us the way to efficiently eliminate any remaining undifferentiated cells from expression mechanisms to regenerative medicine and drug discovery in january kume launched an open innovation research program on ips cell derived insulin producing cells in collaboration with daiichi sankyo and mitsubishi ufj capital combining her technique for efficient production of pancreatic cells derived from human ips cells with daiichi sankyo s technology they aim to improve the manufacturing process and make the performance of ips cell derived insulin producing cells similar to the human body s own pancreatic cells the joint research is a three year program with the goal of creating a practical therapy for severe type diabetes this attempt at creating transplantable cells from es ips cells has attracted attention for its potential to reveal mechanisms of organ differentiation as well as its applications to regenerative medicine and the development of new therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical agents in addition as it has been shown that genetic factors are involved in the development of type diabetes derivation of ips cells from a diabetes patients or editing of specific genes in es ips cells will allow investigation into the relationship of certain genes with the dysfunction of cells kume is also currently working on the generation of other digestive organs in vitro such as liver and intestine from es ips cells at the end of the interview kume had the following advice for early career researchers and students considering careers in research you never know what will happen in the future my experience in discovering something unexpectedly simply by pursuing my research has made me think that young people should be more honest with their interests instead of worrying about the future another thing i believe is important is expanding your horizons while my lab has students from malaysia egypt and many other countries i feel that japanese students are not so interested in studying abroad maybe it s because they already have a great research environment in japan however i recommend that young people be more adventurous and go abroad because that can expand their horizons and relationships finally many students hesitate to continue into doctoral programs but i want them to consider it as an investment in themselves adult stem cells adult stem cells reside in our body tissues and organs they possess the ability to renew themselves and maintain the homeostasis of the tissues and organs es and ips cells are also stem cells culture media culture media are special liquid or solid substances used to grow microorganisms and cells they contain nutrients necessary for culturing shoen kume profile school of life science and technology unravel the complex and diverse phenomena of life information on school of life

john hernlund looking deep for answers to the origins of life faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor and vice director john hernlund earth life science institute as tokyo tech s earth life science institute elsi has evolved it has needed senior scientists to lead research in key areas managers to help run the institute recruiters to search out prospective researchers and students around the world educators to serve as advisor to doctoral students and a friend to invite its many visitors from abroad home for dinner almost since elsi began john hernlund has been doing all this and much more a tenured tokyo tech professor he is a passionate advocate for elsi as well as a top scientist in his deep earth field earth and life as systems you are a geophysicist and you model the dynamics of the interior of the earth what makes your science relevant to an origins of life institute like elsi at elsi we re very interested in understanding the origin of the planet and how it gave rise to life all of our current theories all the evidence suggests that life started more than billion years ago unfortunately we don t have many rocks that are this old to study so answers to lots of questions about what the early earth was like how was it formed how did it give rise to the environment that created life are buried deep inside the planet it s like going to the grand canyon and seeing all the layers of the earth as you go deeper and deeper each one from further back in time life is very old and has been evolving as a part of many systems that are all connected with each other like plate tectonics the composition of the atmosphere the planet s core that makes the magnetic field it s an open system as living things we eat matter which becomes incorporated in our bodies and then we get rid of it so we re actually not a thing we re a process we have to understand how the entire planet collaborates to make something like life possible and how then life evolves over time as the planet changes and how the systems interact with each other these are the great questions of all of natural science and we have to understand what is happening underneath our feet to be able to address all of them this kind of systems thinking is very important at elsi why is that in the th century science took a more focused approach and drilled very deep and also very narrow it made many breakthroughs this way but the big questions like how life came to be on earth or is life possible elsewhere in the universe and if so how would it happen and where should we look these are questions you can t find the answers to by drilling deep and narrow you have to put things together and look at the larger picture life exists on earth because of its unique environment elsi researchers work to a determine the structure of the earth b identify the kind of life that first appeared and when its birth took place and c investigate how those early life forms evolved through multiple perspectives and procedures then by applying those discoveries on genetic information of primitive life forms they aim to further explore d whether life would arise in environments entirely different from earth do any of your own recent findings show these connections some work that made a really big impact on elsi involves the origin of the magnetic field in the earth it connects life on the surface to processes happening very deep beneath our feet in the metallic core where we think that convection currents are responsible for producing the magnetic field by dynamo action heat lost from the deep interior of the planet to the surface drives convection flow and overturn of both the rocky mantle and the liquid metal core inside the earth much like the convection you can see in a bowl of hot miso soup as it cools down of course the rock moves very slowly at speeds of roughly centimeters per year while the liquid core currents move at about millimeters per second in my research i use quantitative models to study the connection between material properties at extreme conditions heat loss from the interior chemical cycling and sustenance of deep magnetism what we ve been able to do with a collaboration of theory and experiments is to open the question of how did the core cool down what did the initial temperature have to be and what was the chemical composition in order to have conditions necessary to have an ancient magnetic field we see in biology that some very ancient forms of life used magnetism for example magnetotactic bacteria produce magnetite crystals inside themselves which helps them orient along the magnetic lines and in the local environment this means they could go find more or less sunlight more or less oxygen different nutrients it was a very ancient form of eyesight based on magnetism coming from the core illustration of bridgmanite enriched ancient mantle structures beams a model proposed by hernlund and colleagues describing how large scale silica enriched highly viscous regions stabilize and organize the pattern of convection in the lower mantle ballmer et al persistence of strong silica enriched domains in the earth s lower mantle nature geoscience no an elsi veteran you were an early hire in elsi what interested you in coming to japan and to the just beginning institute i ve been working with a lot of colleagues now at elsi for many years for example kei hirose the director and i had been working on very similar topics and we had some nice results together hirose san and others were trying to recruit me to come to tokyo tech in or but that was not a good time so we waited until the opportunity came along and i joined the wpi world premier international research center initiative proposal as a principal investigator i came to tokyo tech for the opening ceremony of elsi in and heard impressive speeches from officials of mext the ministry of education culture sports science and technology and from mishima sensei yoshinao mishima tokyo tech president from to they had a vision for how elsi could help the university to become more sustainable and more international and more visible in the world to work as a partner in that effort was something i strongly believed in and it drew me to tokyo tech i still believe in that vision and that it s a wonderful opportunity we have here hernlund in an elsi meeting room designed in traditional japanese decor the space includes tatami mats and hori gotatsu a low table with legroom recessed into the floor why do you think the japanese government has invested so much in the wpi program that includes elsi i think they re doing this because the japanese national universities are facing a demographic implosion with fewer and fewer japanese graduate students the same thing happened in the u s and if you go to top science and engineering institutions there you ll find the students are dominantly non american so this is the model for how a top university survives today they internationalize tokyo tech leadership has known about this for a long time hopefully they will use the lessons of elsi the success and the failures to help the transformation into an international university our involvement in education is key to that and i hope it continues to grow our exclusive use of english is also an important step forward for the university wpi also wanted their institutes to be multi disciplinary we have embraced that and created a special environment for people from very very different fields they come together and talk with each other and have conversations that people say could only happen at elsi we often hear this from colleagues who come to visit there might be a microbiologist talking with an astrophysicist and the kind of thoughts they come up with together can be very unique elsi researchers from various disciplines holding discussions unrestricted by field as a young person what made you decide to go into your field of science i was always interested in nature and when i was young we used to hike in the mountains my father was studying at a school for mines in the u s though he was in chemistry and eventually became an expert in petroleum refining technology but they had a geological museum there and i grew really interested at a young age about the fossils and things like that also i had a great high school teacher who inspired me to study geology when i went to college i started off wanting to be a field geologist trotting around the world but whenever i went someplace to do some geological mapping i wondered what was happening underneath me why are the rock layers tilted this way why is this fault here where did the magma come from the answers to these questions always led to deeper in the earth to peeling back the layers to get at the causes i then went into geophysics and seismology i later started working in a high pressure laboratory doing experiments on rocks at high temperatures and pressures to simulate conditions deep inside the planet a field with a bright future is your field a promising one for students a field with future prospects absolutely one of the new opportunities already present and growing more important is exoplanets we re starting to see thousands of planets beyond our solar system so far most of the interpretative work of the observation of exoplanets has been made by astronomers and so models of the planets and ideas about the planets have been poorly developed there s going to be an increasing need for us to better characterize what these planets are like especially because we want to search for life we have to focus on a specific promising planet and point the telescope there for some time the way to make the decision of which planet to study is to have a better understanding of how planets work in general modeling the connection between the dynamics and evolution of planets and their physical properties the high pressures and temperatures whether they have plate tectonics what is the volcanic activity how was the atmosphere formed all of these things are very central to tackling that science do you think scientists will ever have definite answers about how earth went from having no life to having life i don t think we ll be able to say with certainty how life started on earth but what we will be able to do is to understand how a range of different possibilities might have happened on earth i think that is very valuable because if we understand a range of ways that life could have originated on earth that will help us to then translate that to other planets the more we learn about what was needed for life to begin here the more we ll have some general understanding of how that process should work elsewhere but the particular path that earth took will always be very difficult for us to piece together probably we ll find that the evidence has been destroyed because the early earth was so active and what was on the surface and the crust is now deep inside a kind of perfect crime what would you say to students considering tokyo tech as a school to join tokyo tech is one of the most ambitious universities i see people here who are hungry and who want to work hard i see more of this at tokyo tech than at most places and i think that s always the best kind of place for students to come students have a big role to play here in terms of the history that s being made actually i think it s the most exciting place to study in japan what would you say to young people who are considering to become scientists being a scientist is a very special vocation we are idealists in many ways who really care about the search for knowledge that s more important than anything else more important than becoming rich we really want to do the things that will fundamentally advance humankind s ability to tackle the challenges that all of us face on the planet we already know how important science is to creating a sustainable future for all of us it will become even more important in the coming century because the planet is not doing so well right now in terms of global warming and sustaining our food supplies this will require taking a systems level view and to grow this understanding of how planets live and can survive in the long term i think science can bring a lot of new tools and intuitions to these problems in the future and as well to understanding what are the challenges we face and what things we should be concerned about i hope that more young people become interested in

hiroshi kimura how one fertilized egg leads to different cells and tissues research on epigenome faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor hiroshi kimura cell biology center institute of innovative research all the cells in our body are derived from a single genome but their functions are differentiated as a result of genetic instructions professor hiroshi kimura works to understand the mechanisms of this differentiation the on off switch of gene function the human body is made up of approximately trillion cells although the individual cells that make up the heart nerves skin and other organs vary in shape size and function they all originate from one fertilized egg all cells actually have the same genome but if all cells share the same genome why do they specialize cell differentiation takes place because each cell can receive different instructions from the genome genes undergo activation and inactivation getting expressed as necessary at the right place time and amount one of the systems that controls the activation of genes is the epigenome with the prefix epi meaning in addition to the epigenome acts as information in addition to the genome hiroshi kimura is working to uncover the mechanisms that control the epigenome a genome consists of dna contained in a cell nucleus dna is composed of two chains of four nucleobases adenine a thymine t guanine g and cytosine c the two chains coil around each other to form a double helix a t and g c are the base pairs in the double helix structure and the sequence of the pair of the nucleobases determines the genetic information human dna stretched to its full length would be m long however the dna in a cell is ingeniously coiled around proteins called histones and fit into the cell nucleus which has a diameter of just mm the base sequence in a gene is read copied and transcribed into mrna mrna serves as the necessary information to form a chain of amino acids a process known as translation active genes are transcribed to produce mrna while inactive genes are not at the fundamental level gene expression is controlled by dna sequences and the proteins that bind specific sequences but it is also known that special tags get attached to parts of the dna and histones to tune the expression of genes these special tags come in the form of atom groups such as methyl and acetyl groups the act of attaching a methyl group is called methylation while adding an acetyl group is called acetylation when the regulatory region of a gene such as a promoter or an enhancer is methylated the gene is inactivated when the methyl group is removed the gene can be activated genes are similarly inactivated when a part of a histone is methylated and activated when a part of a histone is acetylated thus the epigenome encompasses these dna and histone tags that activate or inactivate genome functions histone modification kimura explains differentiation of stem cells into skin heart and other cells depends on changes in the epigenome controlling the activation of gene function by controlling dna and histone modification would revolutionize regenerative medicine and the treatment of disease however the mechanisms involved are extremely complex and still not fully understood by adding or removing methyl and acetyl groups at target dna and histone sites gene expression can now be controlled using a method called epigenome editing the name may remind some of another term genome editing which involves modification of genes themselves but while return to the original genome is not possible with genome editing epigenome editing does allows return to the original state because the genes have not been modified using fluorescent proteins to observe gene expression in living cells the first step to understanding the mechanisms of the epigenome is observation in the past researchers observed cells under a microscope determining the location where chemical groups attach to dna and histones is also important however observing their movements was not possible researchers have created a method that enables observation of some proteins in living cells by adding fluorescent proteins yet due to the small size of methyl and acetyl groups they cannot be combined with fluorescent proteins in addition depending on the site of the histone being methylated gene regulation may change specific functional sites need to be identified but a method to do so had not yet been established kimura decided to use antibodies to detect the chemical modifications at specific sites of histones in living cells antibodies are produced in vivo in reaction to specific pathogens interactions known as antigen antibody reactions kimura recollects i started by making antibodies for histones whose specific sites were methylated or acetylated i then considered the potential of adding fluorescence to the antibodies and putting them in nuclei the antibodies react to methyl and acetyl groups in the nuclei and this tells us the precise location of the methylated or acetylated sites of the histone with fluorescent antibodies the dynamics of methyl and acetyl groups can also be observed tracking methylation and acetylation by fluorescently labeled antibody fragments observing histone modification in living cells using a fluorescence microscope antibodies are too big to enter nuclei in fact therefore kimura trimmed the antibodies to small fragments and loaded them into cells and fertilized eggs however this method required loading antibodies into cells for each experiment a requirement that took both time and energy to address this he created genes encoding antibody fragments fused with fluorescent proteins this allowed the generation of mrna and the fluorescent antibody fragments in cells this genetically encoded system alleviates the requirement of loading antibodies into cells each time kimura currently applies this method to animal cell cultures and fertilized zebrafish eggs he then carefully observes the changes in histone modifications associated with development and differentiation and in response to external stimuli aiming to elucidate the mechanisms controlling gene expression seeking universality in life i chose to enter the field of cell biology because in my student days i was attracted to the universality of the central dogma the principle of life now a wide variety of researchers are involved in the study of the epigenome some are trying to produce organs from ips cells and other stem cells using epigenome editing in my case i want to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling gene expression and to do so we are developing imaging technology this technology will take us in new directions and expand our research although there is fierce competition in the field developing our own technology helps us to avoid this and it allows me to do research at my own pace explains kimura in graduate school kimura had a bitter experience that led him to his unique style of research i was in a project that wasn t going well a complete dead end the experience convinced me that when pursuing a goal you will not get meaningful results unless you apply innovative ideas when you test a wide range of ideas most of them will fail but there will also be rare occasions where things go well these experiences grant us great confidence using the technology we have developed in the near future i hope to capture the full picture of epigenetic modification says kimura at the end of the interview kimura was asked what advice he has for students interested in becoming researchers nowadays many students seem pessimistic about their future they worry about not being able to find a job or about research budgets being too small to these students i say be more optimistic as long as you do what needs to be done results will naturally come the job you want will come so don t worry too much about the distant future and get overly cautious continue pursuing the research that you believe in and eventually the right path for you will open this applies not only to research but to everything in life kimura laboratory at suzukakedai campus atom groups groups of atoms have covalent bonds in molecules of compounds and can move from one molecule to another they are the same as the functional groups within molecules such as the methyl group ch ethyl group c h acetyl group ch co hydroxyl group ho and the phosphate group h po they are usually connected to other atoms within molecules stem cells the human body continuously creates cells to maintain health stem cells act as a supply source for the cells there is a wide variety of stem cells each thought to form different organs hemopoietic stem cells for example are responsible for creating blood cells embryonic stem cells can become any tissue or organ such as blood bones skin and brain in addition ips cells are cells artificially made multipotent and which have nearly the same characteristics as embryonic stem cells fluorescent proteins fluorescent proteins exhibit fluorescence any protein can be genetically fused with a fluorescent protein for expression in living cells which allows us to reveal the location and movement of protein molecules osamu shimomura the nobel prize in chemistry laureate purified green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish aequorea victoria central dogma the central dogma is the basic principle of molecular biology developed by francis crick one of the scientists that discovered the double helix structure of dna in the central dogma explains that genetic information in all living creatures is passed from genome dna copied transcribed into mrna and then translated into proteins however the discovery of synthesis of dna from rna in and other discoveries have modified this original concept attempts to clarify the concept of the central dogma remain very meaningful though as advanced studies on gene expression have led to various discoveries such as mrna and trna hiroshi kimura profile the special topics component of the tokyo tech website shines a spotlight on recent developments in research and

yuya kajikawa how do we innovate finding a way using data analysis and knowledge engineering faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor yuya kajikawa department of innovation science school of environment and society with the hope of creating a society where people can achieve their full potential yuya kajikawa professor at the school of environment and society is working to establish a methodology for innovation the times require a transdisciplinary approach i specialize in innovation management innovation is the creation of value by implementing something new that something can refer not only to technology but other creations as well such as business models and systems similarly value includes not only economic benefit but also social and cultural benefit as for management although it is often used to refer to business administration i consider it to mean finding a way therefore innovation management for me means finding a way to create value explains school of environment and society professor yuya kajikawa kajikawa works in the department of innovation science and graduate major in technology and innovation management areas which have attracted many professionals to study alongside other graduate students kajikawa continues there is a framework in innovation research called transition management which focuses on understanding the processes of innovation in transition management we consider three primary factors of innovation technology engineering products and services regime social and technological structures and landscape social vision in the initial stages of innovation a wide range of technologies products and services compete and at this stage it is unknown which will gain popularity the social and technological regimes determine what will dominate the market regimes include technologies markets user preference social infrastructure and industrial policies cultural and industrial structures and corporate strategies regimes are in turn influenced by the landscape which refers to major flows of a community or generation such flows may include an aging society a low carbon society and a society striving to achieve sustainable development goals sdgs successful innovation requires us to not only develop technology but also design regimes and establish a landscape through international initiatives this raises the question what is necessary to achieve innovation as research fields have progressed they have grown increasingly segmented and specialized we have come to believe that any other course would interfere with our global competitive edge as a result we have developed silos and octopus pots of r d of course specialization is necessary researchers who dig deeper into their fields are necessary however it is also essential for us to adopt interdisciplinary approaches for the sake of creating a better society one in which we find solutions for the issues we face such as our aging society and global warming in terms of the technologies and products that promote innovation the necessary knowledge may lie in materials science process engineering electromagnetics or information engineering regime design requires a wide range of knowledge in business administration economics psychology and policy studies forming landscapes could require understanding sustainability and future society design but above all cooperation with society is essential although we have long had interdisciplinary research fields what we need now is transdisciplinary research disciplinary interactions can be divided into four types disciplinarity referring to individual disciplines like science engineering law and humanities multidisciplinarity interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in multidisciplinarity everything is under one umbrella with each discipline pursuing independent goals in interdisciplinarity each of the disciplines under the umbrella works toward a common goal in transdisciplinarity goals focus on activities that intersect with society these include corporate local governmental and regional community activities that are coordinated among a wide range of disciplines and stakeholders gunther tress b rbel tress and gary fry clarifying integrative research concepts in landscape ecology landscape ecology literacy in intellectual property management organization theory strategy theory policy creation and project design are certainly essential in innovation but even more fundamental are methodologies that enable us to think things through for ourselves communicate and at times confront others two methodologies for thinking things through kajikawa studies two general methodologies for thinking things through one being data analysis and the other knowledge engineering in data analysis using statistics machine learning natural language processing network analysis and other information science methods he analyzes the tremendous number of papers and patents coming from transdisciplinary research attains a bird s eye view each research field organizes information and develops tools to extract the most advanced knowledge i have been a bookworm since childhood i loved to read when i was a doctoral student i didn t just do experiments and theory and simulations i read more than papers related to my research theme reading in other fields i also came to learn about bibliometrics bibliometrics is the application of quantitative analysis to bibliographic data used to sort and search for articles in books and journals at the time network analysis was the trend in bibliometrics when i was in my third year as a doctoral student i tried applying network analysis to the papers i read and i found something very interesting specializing in chemical system engineering from his third year as an undergraduate to his doctoral studies kajikawa read a large number of papers for his research on materials he then applied network analysis to those papers what he found was that even if studies shared the same target like thin film for example they showed completely different networks when their materials and approaches were different he also found that different networks applied different mechanisms and models he discovered that data analysis had the potential to extract hidden relationships between seemingly unrelated materials relationships that even materials researchers were unaware of i felt that this tool could bring us new and unexpected possibilities and perhaps help us to discover innovative combinations of materials my colleague pointed out that in addition to helping researchers this method could be useful to companies establishing r d strategies as well as in government policymaking for science and technology i developed this tool for my research but i have since made it available online as an academic overview system for use by researchers and companies in a wide variety of fields kajikawa s second focus knowledge engineering is the study of what knowledge is and the development of methodologies to create knowledge in information science data forms the base of a pyramid information sits above data knowledge sits upon information intelligence sits upon knowledge and wisdom is at the top data becomes meaningful after being collected analyzed and put into context statistical analysis and machine learning are tools used to transform data into information however information and knowledge are different knowledge exists in our brain while information exists outside methods that promote the circulation of explicit information and tacit knowledge are knowledge management the knowledge pyramid nowadays there is extensive development in machine learning for data analysis some say that such methods may take over certain aspects of human work routine data analyses may no longer be performed by people as they can increasingly be handled by information systems but this will free humans up to handle higher level work work that involves applying high level intelligence finding alternatives for issues that lack solutions drawing forms that we desire all while utilizing data analysis will increase while data analysis and knowledge engineering form the core of kajikawa s work as an innovation management specialist he is involved in projects on energy systems including solar power secondary batteries and hydrogen energy as well as iot and materials informatics healthcare informatics and resource circulation what first sparked his interest in technology and innovation management was a factory internship in the spring of his fourth year at university kajikawa clearly remembers the look of dissatisfaction on the face of one of the researchers it was in when japan was described as a country that won in technology but lost in management kajikawa felt strongly that he needed to study management as well the reason it is hard to promote innovation in japan is not a lack of knowledge in material science but a lack of knowledge in business administration and technology management even if we study business administration extensively without apply it it is meaningless we need to think for ourselves how to make use of such knowledge this is why innovation science and knowledge engineering are necessary a society where individuals can realize their full potential what should future society look like and how can we maintain japan s competitiveness in such a society although there are people considering these questions i feel we ignore the very individuals that make up the society we strive to make competitive it is essential to create a society where individuals can realize their full potential this applies to universities as well the role of the university in society is to provide an environment in which students and faculty who conduct research that benefits society can realize their goals a university is not so much a physical entity as it is a social function and it is important we remember this when considering how society can most effectively use its universities i want to try new things i want to experience and create value both for myself and for society that is why i try to create new disciplines to make universities into something even better explains kajikawa asked what message he has for students and junior researchers he states innovation is the creation of value but value is the result of creation so first pursue something new the easiest way to do what no one has done or seen before is to cross borders do not limit yourself by thinking that this is the most you can accomplish or that you shouldn t do something because it s not within your specialty continue expanding your potential by questioning common sense breaking boundaries and thinking for yourself cherish each day and never forget that you have the ability to change society yuya kajikawa profile school of environment and society creating science and

naoyuki hayashi what is health a unique look at exercise and nutrition faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor naoyuki hayashi institute for liberal arts ila everyone wants to live a long and healthy life there is so much interest in the topic of health but what exactly is health institute for liberal arts professor naoyuki hayashi studies health by looking at two specific relationships exercise and ocular blood flow and chewing and nutrition health reveals one s sense of value according to the world health organization health is a state of complete physical mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity hayashi explains it was not until the edo era that the term kenkou health began to be used in japan established by scholar koan ogata in ogata s time the connection between exercise and health was unknown among the japanese in the meiji period japanese author and educator yukichi fukuzawa introduced the general public to the idea that exercise is healthy awareness of health strongly depends on one s sense of value for this reason it is important to have an environment that allows us to understand and freely choose ways to improve our health my role is to help create this environment through science exercise nutrition and rest are three major factors in health drawing on his experience as an athlete hayashi focuses his research on exercise and nutrition exercise and ocular blood flow exercise increases blood flow throughout the body excluding the intestines providing benefits to the circulatory system hayashi decided to look specifically at the effects of exercise on the eyes eyes are extremely important sensory organs when a person s vision deteriorates their quality of life can drop significantly age related macular degeneration and retinopathy are vision impairing conditions often caused by poor blood circulation in the fundus i e interior surface of the eye about years ago i started looking at the relationship between fundus blood flow and exercise hayashi applied laser speckle flowgraphy to measure changes in fundus blood flow occurring with exercise the technique allows for observation of changes over time in light velocity distribution speckle patterns caused by red blood cells and noninvasive measurement of relative blood flow we found that with one session of exercise fundus blood flow increased hayashi recollects moreover we found that blood flow on the surface of the retina where light hits did not increase but blood flow in the back side of the retina did blood flow should increase when it is needed where it is needed and in the amount that is needed this finding suggests that fundus blood flow is extremely well controlled so as to prevent light from being interfered with by increased blood flow on the surface of retina in addition sometimes our vision goes white during vigorous exercise this may be caused by a decrease in blood flow in the brain and eyes in cooperation with physicians hayashi continues to study the impact of exercise on fundus blood flow good tasting food and our eyelids facial blood flow changes in a subject who felt that consomm tasted good red areas indicate high blood flow and blue areas indicate low blood flow after tasting the consomm blood flood in the eyelids increased palatability of tastes is associated with facial circulatory responses chemical senses nutritious good tasting food is important to maintaining a healthy diet when we like the food we eat we feel happy and our facial expressions change while facial expressions are hard to quantify hayashi attempted to measure facial blood flow using laser speckle flowgraphy we measured changes in facial expressions when people ate things they felt tasted good and tasted bad a study of subjects showed that blood flow in the eyelids increased when they ate something that tasted good and decreased when they ate something that tasted bad when the subject did not like the taste blood flow in the nose decreased which is consistent with studies on animals when animals fight they often receive bites on the nose which can bleed blood flow also decreases in animals when they feel discomfort or perceive risk it is natural therefore to assume that blood flow in the human nose decreases in response to something that tastes bad however the discovery that blood flow in the eyelids increases when tasting something good was new and unexpected because changes in blood flow in the eyelids are not externally observable they likely do not function as a means of communication like our cheeks when we blush although blood flow in other parts of the body is controlled by the sympathetic nerve system blood flow in the face is thought to be controlled by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve systems while it is not yet understood why eating something that tastes good increases blood flow this discovery could allow us to use changes in blood flow to determine how patients who have difficulty communicating feel about the taste of food this would make it possible for hospitals to provide food that better suits such patients tastes says hayashi eating slow and chewing well hayashi s research has also revealed connections between health eating small amounts at a time and chewing thoroughly in an experiment on subjects in he found that chewing well and slowly increased the number of calories required to digest food change over time in energy expenditure adjusted for body weight compared with that during pre meal rest filled circles denote rapid eating unfilled circles denote slow eating a difference in energy expenditure between rapid and slow eating was found minutes after eating which continued until minutes after significant difference between rapid and slow trials significant difference compared with rest the number of chews and meal duration affect diet induced thermogenesis and splanchnic circulation obesity it has been suggested that eating rapidly leads to excessive intake which causes weight gain hayashi clarified the relationship between the speed of consumption and body shape in a study targeting college students hayashi surmised that eating slowly and chewing thoroughly increased digestion and absorption which increased energy expenditure in he also conducted an experiment on the effects of chewing gum for minutes after eating we expected energy expenditure to return to baseline soon after chewing stopped but surprisingly we found that chewing gum after a meal resulted in minutes of increased energy expenditure the increase in energy expenditure was related to the action of chewing itself change in energy expenditure per kilogram of body weight for hours after rapid eating left and slow eating right values for individuals means and standard errors are shown the speed of eating significantly influenced energy expenditure compared with the control groups blue circles the gum chewing groups red circles revealed significantly higher energy expenditure the effect of gum chewing however was not as great as that of eating speed effect of postprandial gum chewing on diet induced thermogenesis obesity though the reason has not yet been clarified hayashi theorizes chewing may stimulate the brain to increase burning of brown adipose tissue in future work we hope to determine whether this is the case in addition it had been thought that blood flow in the stomach and intestines increases when food reaches those organs in a study however hayashi found that blood flow in the stomach and intestines increases when chewing starts furthermore compared with chewing tasteless food chewing flavored food increases blood flow to a greater degree hayashi continued these findings suggest that making it a habit to eat slowly and chew well can help in preventing obesity and losing weight the mystery of facial blood flow hayashi began his research on health when he entered the department of sports sciences at waseda university since my elementary school days i ve enjoyed science and swimming that s why i chose this school i was interested in knowing why athletes heart rates are lower i wanted to explore those mechanisms he then started investigating blood flow changes in the face and organs using laser speckle flowgraphy which led him to his current research hayashi explains facial blood flow is still largely a mystery the more i study the deeper my interest becomes currently hayashi s team seems to be the only group working on these topics despite this he hopes to clarify the mysteries of blood flow and identify factors that help maintain and improve health although exercise makes us healthier not everyone s lifestyle involves a lot of movement from what i have found kabuki actors tea masters rakugoka traditional japanese comic storytellers and nagauta classical singers generally live long however with the exception of kabuki actors there is not a great deal of vigorous physical activity in these traditional japanese arts in other words there must be factors related to maintaining health other than exercise nutrition and rest i would like to identify those other factors when asked what advice he has for young researchers hayashi states it is important to study what you are interested in because what you like you will do well if you want to be a researcher however it is also important to be familiar with as many areas as possible narrowing your area of expertise prevents you from increasing the depth and breadth of your research because global trends change quickly others may be involved in research similar to what you are engaged in you need to be strong and flexible enough to allow your goals and perspectives to evolve and continue finding new areas that interest you naoyuki hayashi profile delivering a world class education system information on schools departments and institute for liberal arts inaugurated in april schools

shinya koshihara shining light to alter materials at the blink of an eye faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue professor shinya koshihara school of science department of chemistry for some materials light can induce a change in state through a process known as photo induced phase transition this phenomenon has attracted global attention as a pathway to replacing current electronic devices with ultrafast low energy optical devices a domino effect of change with one photon water can become ice a solid or steam a gas depending on changes in temperature and pressure while maintaining the same composition it can change into different phases solid liquid or gas in a process called phase transition interactions between the atoms and molecules of a material or sometimes even the structure of the molecules of that material change with external conditions such as temperature electric field and magnetic field this can cause drastic and varied alterations in a substance s characteristics magnetism dielectricity conductivity thermal properties etc photo induced phase transition refers to a change in state of a material through simple exposure to light if we could create ultrafast low energy systems that harness weak light to instantaneously switch insulators into metal or electrically neutral organic substances into ferroelectric substances it would be a realization of never before seen photoelectric devices research on such systems is being conducted around the world and shinya koshihara was the first to demonstrate an ultrafast highly efficient photo induced phase transition in an organic material he is also the discoverer of many other substances which exhibit this phenomenon current electronic devices mainly memory devices are driven by phase transitions generated by electric and magnetic fields about years ago i had an interesting conversation over dinner with the supervisors and researchers in my lab where we discussed how it would be great if phase transitions typically controlled by temperature and electric and magnetic fields could also be controlled by light this was the beginning of my current research says koshihara the ability to induce changes in materials through exposure to light has been known for some time in fact photoreaction driven devices are already in practical use however while previous studies showed the change of one molecule with one photon in a photo induced phase transition after one photon changes one electron a successive change in surrounding electrons continues in a domino effect this can significantly alter the structure and characteristics of the substance and cause a phase transition koshihara calls this phenomenon the photo domino effect electronic devices require a tremendous amount of electricity to process and convert information heat loss is also large which raises the issue of whether such devices are sustainable considering their impact on global warming using photo induced phase transition in memory devices would accelerate the speed at which information is converted by more than times while also significantly saving energy this is the reason photo induced phase transition has attracted global attention even with its wide range of problems such as material instability explains koshihara switching an insulator into a metal in an instant as a graduate student koshihara studied the optical functions of proteins that was three years after the fated dinner discussion on photo induced phase transitions in he identified the complete mechanism including the wide scale atomic level structural changes it induced while conducting joint research with a french university he learned through structural analysis using x rays that ttf ca an organic crystal was deformed by light using a special device at the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf in grenoble france we radiated a sample with a pulse laser and then x rays to analyze the structure in cooperation with a group at the university of rennes in an extremely short period of time trillionths of a second the structure of an organic crystal changed and exhibited the characteristics of a ferroelectric substance this is like light changing butter into salt butter and salt are daily necessities in europe university of rennes was located in rennes the capital of the brittany region of france where butter and salt are specialties salt butter and caramel are well known too so when we presented the results of this study people were very excited says koshihara electrons in edo tif pf that do not move at low temperature are excited by light and become free to move without increasing the temperature of the crystal this causes the material to undergo a phase transition from insulator to metal kyoto university professors gunji saito and hideki yamochi were leading experts on superconductivity they visited koshihara with an organic crystal edo tif pf both of them conducted studies on this substance as a candidate organic superconductivity material unfortunately it transited to an insulator when near room temperature and did not exhibit superconductivity the material was branded a failure but saito and yamochi were very interested in the mechanism of the transitions and asked koshihara to analyze its structure and characteristics in a photoexcited state koshihara then asked students in his lab to conduct laser experiments to check its reactivity to light he observed a surprising phenomenon only slight exposure caused a phase transition from insulator to metal electrons fixed in the organic crystal were excited by the light and flowed out like water to form a metal like conductor this happened in just picoseconds two tenths of a trillionth of a second the sensitivity was equal to one photon generating changes in approximately molecules it was a photo induced phase transition after the report on this series of studies research and development on ultrafast photo induced phase transitions accelerated around the world in response to these results the koshihara non equilibrium dynamics project was started in under the exploratory research for advanced technology erato program by the japan science and technology agency jst uncovering biological mechanisms through direct observation during the erato project in addition to seeking out new materials that undergo photo induced phase transition koshihara also worked on development of an imaging system to observe the phenomenon s underlying mechanisms this was in collaboration with shinichi adachi an associate professor at the high energy accelerator research organization kek existing devices could not accurately measure the temporal changes in electron distribution and in crystal structures caused by laser irradiation therefore koshihara and colleagues developed a method called time resolved x ray diffraction in order to capture the ultrafast photo induced phase transition it was necessary to direct a laser beam and x rays toward the same point of the sample at ultra high speed at the kek synchrotron radiation facility while inducing a photo induced phase transition in the sample with a femtosecond one quadrillionth of a second laser beam burst they accelerated the electrons to nearly the speed of light and then irradiated the sample with a picosecond x ray pulse stream it was an amazing procedure that took consecutive photos at a shutter speed of picoseconds an imaging system installed at kek in tsukuba city which can take consecutive photos at a shutter speed of trillionths of a second after four years of trial and error koshihara and colleagues finally developed an imaging system and succeeded in capturing a key mechanism of biological function muscles require oxygen to move and a protein called myoglobin stores oxygen inside muscle tissue it was known that the myoglobin molecule has several cavities to store oxygen as well as carbon monoxide however the cavities are not connected to the outside of the molecule it was not understood how myoglobin takes in oxygen and carbon monoxide from the outside in order to observe how oxygen and carbon monoxide enter myoglobin we needed a monitoring camera says koshihara with smile he identified the pathway with a technique called time resolved x ray diffraction directing a laser beam onto myoglobin to take consecutive photos with x rays revealed that photo induced phase transitions changed the structure of myoglobin molecules one after another and this connected the cavities through which carbon monoxide traveled a dream to freely control physical properties with light koshihara also developed time resolved photoemission electron microscopy tr peem a technique allowing visualization of electron dynamics at femtosecond temporal resolution and nanometer one billionth of a meter spatial resolution through the project development of the frontier of nonequilibrium materials leaded by optical science adopted by the jst crest program in this technique allowed him to capture the movement of electrons on the surface of semiconductors every femtoseconds he also observed the distribution and movement of electrons on the surface of edo ttf pf which has been increasingly regarded as an organic optoelectronic material and how they change with exposure to light koshihara developed femtosecond time resolved photoemission electron microscopy fstr peem a technique allowing visualization of electron dynamics at femtosecond temporal resolution and nanometer spatial resolution in recognition of these achievements koshihara was awarded the humboldt prize which is given to outstanding scientists and scholars working outside of germany since then he has further accelerated the speed of his work it was thought that light could precipitate phase transition from insulator to metal but not metal to insulator however in october it was shown that a picosecond pulse laser burst on ladder type copper oxide crystals that had transitioned into a metallic state after exposure to light could change back into an insulator here not only could dominos fall but they could also stand up again this suggested the applicability of photo induced phase transitions to next generation switching devices capable of turning on and off optically at ultra high speed without the need to convert optical signals to electric signals koshihara s ultimate goal is to realize ultrafast photo induced multiferroics of material properties in he was awarded a grant in aid for specially promoted research from the japan society for the promotion of science jsps koshihara was excited i will focus on my dream of studying photo induced multiferroics multiferroics are substances that have multiple properties such as insulation electric conductivity ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity photo induced multiferroics is an approach to controlling these properties with optical irradiation koshihara continued if we succeed in photo induced multiferroics we will be able to instantly change substances into insulators metals magnets and condensers i envision these materials being applied to create photon computers koshihara concluded by explaining the real pleasure of his research nowadays studies are being conducted that use ai to identify new materials however entering into an unexplored field one without established standards to tell you how to proceed and then succeeding in changing butter into salt with light is something that i believe only humans can accomplish such exciting ideas and discoveries are the best part of my work with increasing global competition in research and development i want young researchers and students to hurry but also be patient youth passes quickly as presented in the song of students gaudeamus igitur if you have a dream you should do everything you can to work toward it however if you are in too much of a hurry you may miss important clues and fail be patient when pursuing your dreams and your achievements will become treasures for the future ferroelectrics materials exhibiting spontaneous polarization regardless of the condition of the external electric field and in which spontaneous polarization can be reversed by the application of a suitable electric field photoelectric devices elements and devices that mutually convert to and from optical signals and energy and

takako yoshida exploring the harmony of humans robots and ai faces tokyo tech researchers issue issue associate professor takako yoshida school of engineering department of mechanical engineering advances in robotics and ai have led to an integration and expansion of interactions between humans and robots with this concerns regarding safety usability controllability and liability have also arisen takako yoshida studies these issues from the perspectives of psychology and mechanical engineering evolution of human machine integration avatars remote control robotics wearable computers and semi automated self driving vehicles but how do we achieve a sense of embodiment presence and immersion with machines how does interacting with machines affect a human user s body and brain what is the ideal integration of human and machine takako yoshida focuses on these and other important questions i majored in cognitive and brain science as an undergraduate and later took my doctorate in psychology i chose psychology because i saw the proliferation of digital devices such as atm touch panels and thought that if we were to apply concepts from cognitive and brain science we could create user interfaces with even greater functionality yoshida looked back on the path she followed and talked about what led her to her current area of interest at the time robotics research was a mechanical engineering pursuit and ai was a specialty of information scientists however as society moves toward coexistence with robots and ai a wider range of experts including those from cognitive science brain science philosophy law and medicine must sit down at the same table to discuss the kind of future we wish to create together according to yoshida that time has arrived she also explains that to address these issues research needs to be conducted on three senses sight touch and somatic sense or proprioception which includes eye and hand movement without these senses it is difficult to create a sense of embodiment and presence in mechanical engineering and information science this approach is known as multilmodal or crossmodal interfaces yoshida has been studying human vision and computer vision with other collaborators looking at both the human eye and robot and computer systems designed to mimic the functions of the human eye in order to find the optimum in visual function i e image processing and recognition in fact humans are only capable of perceiving color and shape accurately in an extremely narrow range at the center of their vision however we feel that we can clearly see in the periphery this is because our brain supplements the image with movements of the head and eyes and associates these with the intention of perceiving an object we can take advantage of this fact she states to provide an improved sense of embodiment and presence thereby creating more natural interactions delay between a remote command and the movement of an avatar causes an abrupt reduction in the sense of embodiment and presence in internet streaming methods are being developed to reduce latency and thereby preserve the sense of embodiment and presence by providing high resolutions and full color for ranges detectable by the human eye and low resolutions and low accuracy for other ranges a human eye function experiment utilizing eye tracking humans can only recognize words when their eyes focus on them words outside the area of focus are not precisely seen as they believe in this experiment text was shown within or outside this area to measure how much the subject could read and how much they miss or imprecisely perceive at their peripheral vision using psychology to create a sense of embodiment with robots yoshida is also involved in the area of power support robotics through the psychiatric neurological disorders program organized by the japan agency for medical research and development power support robotics are wearable devices that support body movement for individuals with physiological or neurological dysfunctions currently movement is computer controlled however control by brain or muscle signals is also possible examples include brain machine interfaces and myoelectric upper limb prostheses the biggest difference between our design and that of other wearable robotics is that our power support robot can be worn while undergoing real time measurement of cerebral blood flow using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri this allows us to see the difference in brain state when the robot moves according to and contrary to the intention of the wearer this further provides a means to quantify the influence robots have on the brain and senses measuring brain state while wearing a power support robot fmri of an individual wearing a power support robot images show the difference in brain activity when the wearer feels and does not feel that the robot moves according to their intention this unique power support robot employs an artificial muscle system developed by professor koichi suzumori of the school of engineering typical robotic actuators are made of metal however this makes them unusable in mri due to the magnetic field generated by the scanner replacing the metal actuators with soft actuators made from silicone fibers solves this problem soft actuators made from silicone fibers containing thin tubes limb flexion and extension are achieved by injecting air into or expelling air from the tubes which expands or contracts the soft actuator yoshida s strength is her ability to quantify human sense and perception through psychological methods and the analysis of data obtained by fmri i use psychophysical methods and the correspondence between physics and psychology allows us to understand the physical information required to generate a certain type of sensation this approach has revealed that a mere millisecond delay in robotic movement decreases the user s sense of embodiment with the robot to achieve effective integration of human and robot the device must provide safe and comfortable control and the information the user wants to convey must be transmitted accurately therefore our group focuses on robotic devices from the perspective of cognitive and brain science through this approach we hope to develop power support robots that function as if they were a part of the wearer s body on coexistence with ai coexistence with robots and ai in human society is another important area of research for yoshida as a principal investigator in the human information technology ecosystem project funded by the japan science and technology agency jst she engages in joint research with experts in law and philosophy in this project we explore the question of who responsibility should fall upon when an ai or robot with ai causes an accident the manufacturer the user or the ai itself insisting that manufacturers bear responsibility would cause a scaling down of the ai and robotics industries as companies seek to reduce risk in addition ais learn and change through interaction with users therefore some argue that it would be unfair to make manufacturers completely liable for mishaps furthermore wearable robotics and vehicle autopilot systems create circumstances where humans and ai share control over the same functions the decisions made by a human operator and that made by an ai may not always match and this can change the focus of responsibility in the event of an accident fundamentally we might ask is it even sensible to hold an ai or robot responsible for a mishap many matters regarding ai and robots have been discussed how far would an ai or robot have to develop to be considered legally equal to humans is it possible for ais and robots to exhibit common sense and emotion would we even want them to have such abilities some argue that determining responsibility is just one of the relatively new ideas from western society and that it may be possible to resolve these new social issues regarding ai and robots using methods that do not depend on determining the responsible party with the term singularity being used so often recently many issues have emerged regarding the integration of humans and machines and coexistence with robots and ais addressing these issues says yoshida requires not only the viewpoints of law philosophy and sociology experts but also a scientific approach to clarify the influences on the human brain and psychology at the conclusion of the interview yoshida had some advice for students and early career researchers many young people tend to worry about which field they should enter liberal arts or science engineering or physics i would advise them not to worry about this rather pursue what you are really interested in what you want to do for the rest of your life careers in science are not the only way this goal can be achieved especially in the area of human sense and perception that i am engaged in many graduates have chosen not to pursue careers in science but have started their own businesses or become media artists and writers i would encourage young people to follow their own paths to their goals don t limit yourself to small frameworks that narrow your possibilities members of yoshida laboratory avatar a graphic representation of the user or some variation thereof user interface a

nobuyuki kawai exploring the origins of the universe and elements with gamma ray bursts issue professor nobuyuki kawai department of physics school of science gamma ray bursts prove to be key in astronomy an enthusiastic professor nobuyuki kawai states in september the first detection of gravitational waves produced during a merger of black holes opened the door to the field of gravitational wave astronomy as someone involved in research on gamma ray bursts i want to spend the rest of my career in gravitational wave astronomy artist s conception of a merger of black holes which produces gravitational waves gravitational waves are propagations of the distortion of space time caused by the presence of mass albert einstein predicted their existence some years ago strong gravitational waves are thought to be produced from the merging of binary neutron stars or binary black holes or other events such as supernovae a gamma ray burst is a flash of strong gamma rays from a point in the sky in the s gamma ray bursts were first observed by us surveillance satellites to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear tests however the source and mechanism of the emissions remained unclear for years the biggest reason for this difficulty was that the majority of gamma ray bursts last just tens of seconds and their location is unpredictable gamma ray bursts are seen at the moment a black hole is created currently it is believed that energy generated by the explosion of a star is gathered into a thin jet and emitted as a blast at a relativistic speed however fundamental details such as the source and mechanism of generation are still unclear in august however the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo detected gravitational waves associated with the merger of neutron stars the strange weak gamma ray bursts that were detected gave rise to a new stage in research kawai explains i was originally working in the field of x ray astronomy in the s i was involved in the observation of neutron stars that emit x rays including x ray pulsars and x ray bursters at that time it was generally presumed that gamma ray bursts also originated from neutron stars this led me to start working on gamma ray bursts as an extension of my studies on x ray astronomy gamma ray bursts were an obscure phenomenon at the time and some colleagues told me that i would be wasting my career a small robotic telescope that automatically measures sudden astronomical phenomena such as gamma ray bursts this prototype incorporates software developed by kawai lab into a commercially available telescope kawai plans to install the telescope on the roof of his lab s building for testing a significant turning point came in when an italian dutch x ray astronomy satellite first recorded the afterglow of gamma ray bursts interestingly x ray afterglow and visible light sources were detected at the same place unlike gamma ray bursts which last just a few seconds the afterglow was observed to last over a longer period of time this allowed for accurate measurement of direction distance from the earth and amount of energy the analysis yielded remarkable results revealing that most of the gamma ray bursts were generated billions of light years away from the earth such a tremendous amount of energy covering vast distances in such a short amount of time could only be produced by one of two phenomena one is a star with a mass of several tens of that of the sun undergoing gravitational collapse at the end of its short life to produce a black hole the other is when extremely compact neutron stars crash into each other based on the evidence it was concluded that gamma ray bursts with durations longer than a few seconds which accounts for the majority were caused by the former meanwhile it was also found that short gamma ray bursts lasting less than one second can occur in a galaxy where massive stars do not exist a finding that supported the theory that this class of gamma ray bursts were produced in the formation of black holes as a result of the merger of binary neutron stars according to kawai although the detection of gravitational waves and gamma ray bursts in seemed to prove the theory they differ from short gamma ray bursts this means that we have to observe more to see if we can clarify the details combining the observation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves such as gamma rays x rays and visible rays has shown us a path that may lead to significant progress in understanding the origin and composition of the universe gamma ray bursts emitted by the merger of binary neutron stars gamma ray bursts are extremely interesting to me says kawai we know that gamma ray bursts are emitted as high speed jet flows traveling very close to the speed of light however we still do not know how black holes or neutron stars produce them i m also attracted by the thrill of exploring the mystery of the origin of the universe gamma ray bursts are the key to finding out how many black holes there are in the universe and when where and how they were produced in addition observing the universe when it was formed requires us to look out to its very edge it is however hard to observe stars in such distant locations because they are very dim gamma ray bursts on the other hand are very bright so they can be observed with satellites and telescopes even those produced when the first star in the universe was formed another reason for my interest in gamma ray bursts is my desire to understand the mystery of r process elements a group of elements that are heavier than iron we already know that hydrogen and helium were created during the big bang billion years ago and that the elements up to and including iron were created through nuclear fusion in the interior of stars however we still do not know where and how r process elements which include gold and platinum were created it was once speculated that these elements were created in supernovae however the theory getting more favor now is that they were created during the merger of binary neutron stars and scattered into space gravitational wave astronomy is key to understanding the origin of these elements observing the most distant gamma ray bursts in recorded history kawai has developed instruments to observe gamma ray bursts the first was the high energy transient explorer hete satellite developed in a collaboration of american french and japanese teams while he was working at riken hete gathered critical evidence proving that the gravitational collapse of massive stars produced long life gamma ray bursts because gamma ray bursts must be observed immediately after detection the gamma ray coordinates network gcn at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa transmits information on gamma ray bursts to observers around the world via the internet as soon as they are detected kawai began development of robotic telescopes around he designed a system that responds automatically to gamma ray burst information received from the gcn with support from the national astronomical observatory of japan naoj and the institute for cosmic ray research icrr at the university of tokyo kawai has placed robotic telescopes with a diameter of cm in asakuchi okayama prefecture and hokuto yamanashi prefecture to observe the afterglow of gamma ray bursts gamma ray burst coordinates network gcn the mitsume robotic telescope was developed for automated observation it is still in service the most impressive observation for me was the afterglow of gamma ray bursts caught by the subaru telescope on hawaii island in analysis of the spectrum showed that these bursts occurred billion light years away a mere billion light years after the big bang this was the most distant gamma ray burst ever observed in addition the information showed that although electrons and protons recombined about light years after the big bang and that the universe was neutralized re ionization had already occurred by the time of these gamma ray bursts this was an extremely important achievement for clarification of the ancient state of the universe and the original formation of stars and galaxies says kawai for his achievements utilizing hete and the subaru telescope kawai was awarded a commendation for science and technology research category from the minister of education culture sports science and technology in and the chushiro hayashi prize from the astronomical society of japan in spectrum of the afterglow of the most distant gamma ray bursts billion light years detected by the subaru telescope when the gravitational waves were detected in august some telescopes in japan and other countries around the world chased the electromagnetic waves associated with the merger of neutron stars analysis of the data revealed that the merger of neutron stars occurred in a location that was approximately billion light years away from the earth my research team worked to detect x rays associated with the gravitational waves utilizing the monitor of all sky x ray image maxi mounted on the international space station s kibo module unfortunately we were unable to get the results we were hoping for because the gravitational wave event occurred in a direction that could not be observed however when the sensitivity of ligo and virgo are improved and the japanese gravitational wave telescope kagra starts operation it will be possible to observe the merger of neutron stars more than times a year it will be possible to observe electromagnetic radiation from neutron stars including light x rays and possibly short gamma ray bursts to examine what happens in the merger of neutron stars says kawai with excitement in cooperation with matunaga lab at the department of mechanical engineering kawai s team is now working on the development of a small observation satellite hibari which will provide enhanced detection of gamma ray bursts they plan to launch the satellite in four or five years professor kawai then described the real pleasure of his research first gamma ray bursts were a mysterious phenomenon then in an afterglow was discovered later in research advanced significantly through the detection of a merger of neutron stars with the gravitational wave detector looking back on these events i can say that the real pleasure for me is seeing my field expand more than i could ever have imagined with unexpected discoveries and encounters with mystery every day i feel that nature is rich and plentiful beyond human imagination and i am delighted that being a researcher has allowed me to experience this i would like for young people who are thinking about going into research to first follow their curiosity rather than stick to research goals that make immediate contributions to society in addition the experience to solve mysteries for which nobody knows the answers will help them to address new problems in our evolving society black holes when an object is smaller than a specific size determined by its mass its gravitational field becomes so strong that not even light can escape from its surface to better understand this concept imagine for example the mass of a star ten times larger than our sun being stuffed into a volume the size of new york city when viewed from a distance this gives the appearance of a black hole that only has gravitational pull we think that black holes with masses approximately ten times that of the sun are created when a massive star collapses into its center as it reaches the end of its life however the origin of super massive black holes found at the centers of galaxies is still the subject of speculation the first gravitational waves detected were generated by the merger of two black holes each with masses some times that of our sun but astronomers are still debating their origin space time according to the theory of relativity time and space cannot be separated when an observer moves time and space are fused together therefore they are called space time neutron stars different from normal stars neutron stars are composed mainly of neutrons like giant atomic nuclei the mass of a neutron star is almost the same as the sun but its radius is only km the radius of the sun is km they are extremely dense which produces enormous gravity on the surface a highly magnetized rotating neutron star is observed as a pulsar that emits electromagnetic waves periodically supernova supernovae are enormous explosions of stars that radiate intense light for months they occur in the milky way galaxy approximately once every years the old supernovae that could be seen with the naked eye were referred to as guest stars by ancient chinese astronomers there are two major types of supernovae the first type of supernova occurs when the core of a massive star collapses at the end of its life blowing away part or all of the star and sometimes leaving a black hole or a neutron star as the remnant the second type of supernova happens when an old dense white dwarf explodes as a result of thermonuclear runaway reaction gamma rays electromagnetic waves propagations of variations of electric and magnetic fields exert different influence on matter and therefore have different names depending on their wavelengths for example electromagnetic waves with wavelengths larger than mm are called radio waves and those measuring between and m are visible light waves smaller than nm behave more like particles and are called gamma rays gamma rays emitted from the universe react with the atmosphere and do not reach the earth s surface therefore it is necessary to search outside the atmosphere to directly detect gamma rays emitted by astrophysical sources stars stars are spherical masses of high temperature gases held together by their own gravity with an internal heat source like the sun their heat source is the nuclear fusion at the core most of the stars seen in the night sky are these stars the greater the mass of a star the faster the fusion reaction at its core occurs making stars shine brighter burn hotter and die faster r process elements among the elements in the universe those from carbon through iron as ordered by the atomic number are synthesized at the cores of stars by thermonucliear fusion elements heavier than iron are considered to be created by adding neutrons to atomic nuclei in special environments in particular some elements such as neodymium and other rare earth elements silver gold platinum and uranium are synthesized by capturing numerous neutrons on short timescales rapid process and therefore called r process elements spectrum electromagnetic waves emitted from celestial bodies have components with a wide range of wavelengths as sunlight can be separated into rainbow colors through a prism so can light or electromagnetic waves in general from celestial bodies be separated according to wavelength this decomposition is called a spectrum when a certain element or ions emit or absorb electromagnetic waves they appear in the spectrum at a specific wavelength movement of a light source can be detected through the shift in wavelength caused by the doppler effect the universe is expanding such that more distant celestial bodies appear to be moving at greater speeds thus shifts in wavelength make it possible to estimate the distances to distant celestial bodies nobuyuki kawai profile school of science exploring the truth and creating knowledge information on school of science inaugurated

nobuhiro nishiyama transforming medical care through polymer based nanomachines issue professor nobuhiro nishiyama laboratory for chemistry and life science institute of innovative research creating drugs using polymers in b c the greek philosopher hippocrates known as the father of western medicine wrote that good medicines work where we want them to work medicines that affect unhealthy cells only have been the elusive dream of scientists for thousands of years working at tokyo tech s laboratory for chemistry and life science professor nobuhiro nishiyama strives to realize such medicines utilizing polymers the process of developing medicines is called drug discovery a field that has until recently focused on low molecular compound design we do however sense that we are reaching a limit with the existing process as the probability of success in new drug development is now said to be one in thousand what s more the process often requires an investment of more than years and hundreds of millions of dollars while very effective drugs continue to be developed concerns about unacceptable side effects have also increased with all these obstacles we decided to focus on ways to deliver drugs to target cells by utilizing polymers if we can use these polymers as platforms for drug delivery and incorporate smart functionalities that allow them to attach to unhealthy cells or make cells visible from outside the body then i feel we will have developed the ultimate medicine nishiyama elaborates the technology that delivers the necessary amount of drug to the necessary location is called a drug delivery system dds the concept of drug discovery using polymers was advocated by european researchers in the mid s so why is it attracting renewed attention now nishiyama explains ddss were too advanced for the time when low molecular compound medicines were the main focus since drug discovery has become more difficult and nucleic acid drugs and biomedicines have become the trend ddss have once again come into the spotlight in the past to years synthesis technology has significantly improved to allow the development of a wide variety of polymers and the application of functional molecules such as aptamers and single chain antibodies has improved performance although it was once thought impossible to develop nucleic acid and antibody drugs they are becoming the trend in pharmaceuticals i believe that drug discovery using polymers will continue to increase in importance figure polymer drug model developed by polymer chemist helmut ringsdorf from ddss to nanomachines recently new concepts in medical treatment have developed concepts such as precision medicine which customizes healthcare with medical decisions treatments practices and products tailored to the individual patient this requires more advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies it has also become necessary to equip ddss with more functions beyond simply delivering drugs these functions include the ability to reach any location inside the body the ability to respond to extremely small changes in lesions the ability to reveal symptoms outside the body and the ability to change the speed of drug delivery fantastic voyage a american film about a miniaturized submarine injected into a patient to treat a blood clot in his brain is today somewhat less fantastical the technology of a nanomachine made of polymers measuring nanometers in diameter is in high demand and ddss are fast evolving into these in vivo submersibles as a student of professor kazunori kataoka director general of the innovation center of nanomedicine iconm and a leading expert in dds research nishiyama developed a nanocapsule polymer micelle dds containing cisplatin this capsule nanometers in size selectively penetrates cancer tissues which have larger spaces on their vessel walls while avoiding the blood vessels of healthy tissues there are no apparent side effects and clinical studies are being conducted on humans in the hope of achieving practical application in the near future to provide effective treatment nishiyama also developed a nanomachine contrast agent this agent contains manganese ions which are also used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri ions are emitted according to changes in ph the levels of which are lower in cancer tissues due to glucose hypermetabolism particularly in low oxygen hypoxic regions which are thought to include cancer cells with a high degree of malignancy ph is markedly low due to anaerobic metabolism mri experiments on mice have shown that injection of the nanomachine contrast agent allows highly accurate detection of cancer cells measuring only millimeters in diameter that have spread to the liver and the visualization of hypoxic regions without invasive biopsy nishiyama comments a nanomachine contrast agent makes it possible to predict the accumulation of dds in cancer sites using the nanomachine contrast agent during medical treatment allows us to examine effects promptly and this leads to more effective treatment targeting specific points undoubtedly nanomachine technology is innovating medical care aiming for simple yet highly functional nanomachines the application of nanomachines to medical treatment requires ease of use cost control and quality assurance in accordance with pharmaceutical regulations complex systems allow us to write good academic papers but they make practical application extremely challenging nishiyama aims to provide advanced functions with as simple a structure as possible and is working on the development of new materials for use in nanomachines one of these is a water soluble polymer that recognizes transporter density in individuals with cancer and selectively interacts with cancer cells antibodies have found broad application in the targeting of specific cancer cell sites they recognize antigens on the surface of cancer cells however recognizable cancer antigens are limited and the antibodies are not effective against all antigens in addition there is a risk of cancer cells with a low level of cancer antigen expression increasing after treatment resulting in recurrence on the other hand targeting the molecules that are essential for the survival of cancer cells is thought to be effective against all cancer cells such molecules however also exist in normal cells making it impossible to target cancer cells only therefore nishiyama has focused on the specific metabolism of cancer cells cancer is considered a metabolic disorder positron emission tomography pet imaging which can visualize glucose metabolism has been applied broadly in cancer diagnosis it is known that glutamine metabolism promotes cancer cell development as well as glucose metabolism generally glutamine is taken in intracellularly via a transporter nishiyama developed a water soluble polymer that interacts with cancer cells by introducing multiple glutamine structures to the polymer side chain while mostly overlooking normal cells with low transporter expression levels this polymer interacts strongly with high transporter expression level cancer cells via multidentate binding figure in other words the polymer binds specifically to cancer cells by recognizing the density of the transporter and can target any cancer cell with active glutamine metabolism figure development of polymers that compose nanomachine capsules with cancer cell affinity such design is impossible with antigens that target one protein molecule it is therefore necessary to use polymers water soluble polyethylene glycol peg has been used for nanomachine capsules to deliver anti cancer drugs and contrast agents nishiyama believes his water soluble polymer with affinity to cancer cells can be used as an alternative to peg designing such polymers with smart functions will allow us to develop simple yet highly functional nanomachines the research described above is a recent achievement but nishiyama has been working on a wide range of research and development activities aiming to realize future medical care this includes the development of nanomachines for nucleic acid medicine delivery as well as minimally invasive treatment systems one day treatment requiring no hospitalization through the integration of medical devices and nanomachines in a government supported program organized by the japan agency for medical research and development amed and the coi stream by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext development for practical use in nishiyama was assigned to the polymer chemistry division at the chemical resource laboratory crl the predecessor of the current laboratory for chemistry and life science cls crl had a long history of research on polymers professor hideki shirakawa who received the nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery and development of conductive polymers also carried out his research here for this reason i feel both pride and responsibility in my role as a leader in this lab nanomachine research requires synthesis as well as cell and animal experiments with the tremendous support we receive from cls we enjoy an environment that allows us to conduct all of these experiments i also greatly appreciate the laboratory environment for students here in fact i was a graduate student studying under professor kataoka when i developed cisplatin nanocapsules which are now undergoing clinical trials i hope to work with graduate students to develop practical solutions for healthcare the efforts of these students now may lead to improved medical care that saves lives in the future it is important for us to carry out research with this dream in mind says nishiyama conducting research and development however is not always easy challenging research fails more often than it succeeds as was the case with research on conductive polymers carried out by professor shirakawa many discoveries came from failures it is important for us to follow our interests without worrying about success or failure considering potential results is of course important but we should not be too hasty with our conclusions even with failures we get unexpected results my mentor professor kataoka always told me never ever ever give up he meant that we should stick with what we have decided to do although i have had repeated failures in my research i have continued with the strong intention to unveil something special i will continue moving forward to achieve my dreams i want all students to understand the importance of not giving up nishiyama concludes polymers very large molecules classified into natural and synthetic polymers synthetic polymers are composed of repeated specific monomers and are used in a wide range of fields such as chemicals automobiles electronic devices energy and biotechnology low molecular compound small compounds with low molecular weight often several or less which are distinguished from biopharmaceuticals nucleic acid drug drug whose basic structure is a natural and chemically modified nucleotide many drugs can be designed for different targets depending on their nucleotide sequences biomedicines pharmaceuticals made of proteins and nucleic acids and manufactured extracted or semi synthesized utilizing living things these differ from low molecular medicines and are becoming the trend in pharmaceuticals due to advances in biotechnology aptamers nucleic acid molecules or peptide molecules that bind to specific target molecules usually created from a large random sequence pool and expected to be the molecular alternative to antibodies single chain antibodies fusion proteins of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins connected with a short linker peptide expected to be an alternative to antibodies antibody drug made of molecules that bind to the target to deliver the immune function of a living body with an extremely high degree of specificity rank highly in the anticancer drug market and have become the mainstream in pharmaceuticals glucose the most important energy source for a living body anaerobic metabolism metabolism of glucose without oxygen energy production efficiency is low and organic matter is generated water soluble polymer a synthetic polymer soluble in water transporter exists on the cell surface to transport ions glucose and amino acids across the membrane antibodies responsible for the immune function of the living body antibodies bind with high specificity to their target neutralizing and removing pathogens cancer antigens proteins with which the immune system recognizes cancer cells her which exists in breast cancer cells is one of these glutamine a type of amino acid cancer cells take in more glutamine and proliferate as more fatty acids proteins and nucleic acids are synthesized for the cells to survive nobuhiro nishiyama

naoki kagi an architectural viewpoint on reducing indoor health risks issue associate professor naoki kagi department of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society airtightness in houses and buildings in japan has greatly improved contributing significantly to energy efficiency however excessive energy saving measures may cause unintended damage to our health and it is therefore important for us to consider multilateral viewpoints to maintain a healthy lifestyle explains naoki kagi associate professor at the department of architecture and building engineering there are five factors that influence the indoor environment sound heat air water and light kagi focuses on air he continues there are a wide range of invisible contaminants in the air and we simply inhale them involuntarily i am trying to visualize these contaminants by detecting them measuring their concentration and identifying their properties and sources so that i can propose measures to counteract them new indoor environmental contaminants before the use of air conditioning systems spread in japan some decades ago homes and buildings were ventilated by opening windows in summer however during and after a period of rapid economic growth air pollution and heat island phenomena gradually increased as did the use of air conditioning energy saving measures were also promoted at this time as a result the energy efficiency of air conditioners improved and buildings were equipped with increased heat insulation and airtightness natural ventilation in buildings decreased in addition natural interior materials for floors walls and ceilings were replaced with artificial substances such as plastics which contained a variety of chemicals the low ventilation and high indoor emission of contaminants resulted in new health issues such as sick building syndrome sbs and sick house syndrome shs sbs and shs are medical conditions where people experience runny nose fatigue dizziness and general malaise caused by chemicals used to produce construction materials for newly built houses and buildings when these symptoms first began to appear the causes were unknown however studies gradually revealed that they were caused by high concentrations of volatile organic compounds vocs generated by formaldehyde and toluene in paints and adhesives used in building construction and the manufacture of furniture as well as anti termite agents the national government acted by initiating certain measures such as specifying guidelines on allowable indoor concentrations of vocs in the act on the maintenance of sanitation in buildings set the standard value for formaldehyde used in buildings and the revision of the building standards act in obligated the installation of ventilation equipment and limited the use of anti termite agents and building materials that emit formaldehyde many people believe that shs and related issues have now been resolved however i don t think they have been addressed sufficiently despite improvements in building materials and ventilation systems the excessive use of housekeeping supplies such as room fragrances and deodorizers the misuse of air cleaners and humidifiers and the increase in damage caused by flooding are just a few factors that raise concerns about new and increased indoor environmental contaminants in addition we continue to discover new contaminants due to significant improvements in the quality of measurement devices kagi says dealing with new chemical substances such as pm and svocs such new indoor environmental contaminants which are of great interest to kagi include ultrafine particles such as particulate matter pm airborne semi volatile organic compounds svocs that adsorb to house dust microbial volatile organic compounds mvocs generated from mold and other microorganisms in addition damage from mold and the generation of chemical substances associated with inundation caused by severe rainstorms and typhoons both above and below floor level have been of particular concern recently classification of volatile organic compounds ultrafine particles such as pm are usually brought in with the outdoor air but can also be generated inside buildings through cooking candles aroma diffusers hair sprays hairdryers cigarette smoke copy machines and laser printers it has also been confirmed that chemical substances emitted from room fragrances and deodorants react with ozone in the air to form secondary particles the increasing popularity of wooden houses in japan has generated other issues the aroma of natural woods such as the japanese cypress is believed to have a relaxing effect however the source of the aroma limonene which is a terpene reacts with ozone in the air to form secondary particles kagi explains unfortunately there are few studies on the impact of ultrafine particles and secondary particles on human health and many details have yet to be clarified although they are not of the utmost concern we need to get the necessary information i want to clarify the state of these particles in the indoor environment from a scientific viewpoint kagi adds svocs used as plasticizers for plastic have low volatility until recently they were thought to exist at very low concentrations in indoor air therefore having a negligible influence on the environment the latest studies however suggest that various svocs detected in adsorbed house dust are associated with the onset of infantile asthma it is therefore important to consider the relationship between gaseous svocs and dust in the indoor environment when examining the complex behaviors of contamination there is a substance ethyl hexanol that has not yet been specified by any regulations di ethylhexyl phthalate dehp is added as plasticizer svoc to soften ingredients while manufacturing vinyl chloride products when vinyl chloride products are attached to concrete the water contained in the concrete hydrolyzes dehp and generates a large amount of ethyl hexanol says kagi in recent years concrete and other materials have absorbed large amounts of water due to severe rainstorms that have occurred throughout japan because the concrete has not had adequate time to dry between these storms the emission of ethyl hexanol may have increased the odor is one unpleasant factor but there is also concern about its effect on human health i am paying close attention to this kagi states severe precipitation has other influences on the indoor environment water in itself is not an indoor environmental contaminant but when concrete and wooden materials remain wet for long periods mold and bacteria may grow these can cause allergic reactions and produce mvocs kagi wants to call more public attention to mold and mvocs it is very important for us to manage indoor humidity the use of humidifiers and hanging laundry indoors can easily raise humidity to levels in excess of to percent the standard range specified by the government high humidity or dampness is associated with health problems humidity in and of itself is not harmful to the air environment but identifying new indoor air pollution associated with humidity has become one of my major topics of research kagi says that achieving the best indoor air environment requires not only that architectural design be considered more seriously before construction but also that occupants understand how to reduce the contaminants they emit within the living environment architectural design is a top down process it starts from overall design then descends to structural design and finally reaches environmental design this makes it a challenge to consider the indoor environment at the first design stage to address this situation architects must deepen their understanding of the environment and building equipment systems and we as environment and building equipment systems specialists must increase our efforts to educate others about issues related to the indoor environment laws and regulations must also be changed guidelines need to be established and occupants need to be taught appropriate maintenance of their living environment says kagi a wide range of indoor contaminants a wide range of indoor contaminants contaminants such as pm ultrafine particles and ozone also exist in the outdoor air vocs and svocs are generated from materials used in building interiors furniture and housekeeping supplies mvocs are generated from microorganisms vocs may react with ozone and generate ultrafine particles in the air although svocs have low volatility they interact with other substances such as house dust and airborne particles a wide range of other factors including building performance temperature humidity and resident behavior influence indoor air features working on immediate issues while remaining alert to opportunities kagi was involved in architectural sanitation and studies on living environments as a researcher at the national institute of public health niph under the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw between and his experience during that time had a significant influence on his choosing the indoor air environment as his research topic mhlw is responsible for the act on the maintenance of sanitation in buildings and niph conducts supportive research and training at niph kagi was assigned to train public health center employees responsible for on site building inspections through this experience he began to understand that achieving a comfortable indoor environment would require not only proper building maintenance but also a fundamental review of building planning and design this understanding prompted him to return to his alma mater tokyo tech in kagi looks back on his experience at niph it allowed me to interact with people in a wide range of fields including healthcare sanitation chemical engineering and analytical chemistry as well as architecture and this helped me to significantly broaden my perspective one of the great advantages of conducting research at tokyo tech is the wide variety of equipment available for the study of indoor environmental contaminants this equipment includes an artificial weather chamber and analytical and particle measurement devices tokyo tech also provides the environment and professionals required for effective joint research it is very rare for architectural departments at universities to have such a wide range of experimental equipment we often conduct joint field surveys experiments and analyses with other universities and institutions the significant improvement in analyzers and measurement devices has also helped to increase awareness of environmental contaminants my research focuses on the measurement of environmental contaminants and the clarification of indoor phenomena while health effect study is not my specialty i continue to work with researchers in various fields to clarify environmental issues that affect health and to provide accurate information and create proposals for solutions my goal is to contribute to the reduction of health problems associated with the indoor environment from the viewpoint of architectural environmental engineering collecting indoor air and inserting it into a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms device through pre treatment equipment enables qualitative and quantitative analysis on small amount of vocs from field surveys and experiments interior

satoshi matsuoka supercomputer tsubame remains at the leading edge issue professor satoshi matsuoka global scientific information and computing center gsic tokyo tech s supercomputer tsubame achieves world s highest power efficiency reads a june newspaper headline professor satoshi matsuoka smiles the tokyo tech global scientific information and computing center gsic professor is the lead developer of tsubame the latest version of the institute s supercomputer which ranked no on the green list introduced in green was designed to encourage improvements in supercomputer power efficiency with rankings from to published twice each year another supercomputer aist ai cloud aaic developed by the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology aist was third in these rankings the performance of these two machines demonstrates the highly advanced power efficiency of japanese supercomputers matsuoka was also involved in designing aaic top supercomputers on green list tsubame which gets its name from the tokyo tech seal is an extremely high efficiency large scale cluster type supercomputer it currently provides supercomputing services to both academic and industrial users tokyo tech and many other universities research institutes and private companies have been achieving outstanding results with this leading edge machine tsubame tsubame compute node configuration achieving the world s top computation processing speed and power efficiency matsuoka started research on cluster supercomputers in on the basis of his findings he started full scale development of tsubame in since the first production startup in march the tsubameseries has been recognized as demonstrating the leading edge of supercomputing technology the second incarnation of the machine tsubame went into production in november and was followed by the tsubame upgrade in september the brand new tsubame was installed and began production in august this was the third time that tsubame ranked no on the green list tsubame kfc which was developed as an experimental prototype for tsubame was ranked no in november and june this however is the first time it was rated no in the world as a petaflops scale production supercomputer which is very meaningful for us says matsuoka the green list assesses power efficiency based on processing speed per w of power consumption this figure does not include the power required to cool the supercomputer which is a significant addition to the base machine power in actual use sometimes almost equaling the machine power itself cooling the tsubame however requires only percent of total power consumption this is roughly one tenth of that required by other supercomputers proving that matsuoka s creation is truly a practical supercomputer offering extremely high power efficiency tsubame also boasts world class processing speed tsubame was ranked no in the world and no in japan in the top list in november when it began service in addition assistant professor takashi shimokawabe and associate professor akira nukada at gsic created the world s first detailed simulation of alloy crystallization utilizing tsubame professor matsuoka s remarkable achievements were recognized with an acm gordon bell prize the most prestigious award in the field of supercomputers jointly with shimokawabe and his supervisor and joint researcher professor takayuki aoki along with nukada tsubame has contributed to high performance computing hpc with remarkable processing speed power efficiency and low cost the newest version tsubame is also expected to achieve top performance in japan in simulation science as well as in new workloads such as ai and big data processing matsuoka explains theory and experimentation have traditionally played significant roles in scientific development recently however computational science represented by computer simulation has come to play a significant role as the third wave in science and moreover data science has rapidly attracted attention as the fourth wave of science tsubame realizes the high performance application of data science ahead of other supercomputers and this has attracted attention around the globe setting rather than following the trend what enables matsuoka to stay at the forefront of world class supercomputer development the reason i incorporated ai and big data functions into tsubame was not because people started paying attention to them when the potential for a rapid explosion in information was first considered more than ten years ago we predicted that larger scale data processing would be required and started basic research on how to make it happen on a supercomputer tsubame is the result of such longstanding research results rather than responding to change we anticipated and started research well in advance of it says matsuoka the professor always has his eyes set to years into the future something that has not changed since he started work on the first tsubame i always seek to set rather than follow the trend when i conduct research and development matsuoka and his team were the first to facilitate a graphics processing unit gpu on a large scale supercomputer tsubame became known throughout the world for a hybrid architecture that integrates scalar operation by cpu and vector operation by gpu the world s first application of a large scale gpu enabled astonishingly high processing speed and power efficiency since then the development of supercomputers using gpus has become a global standard supercomputers used at the oak ridge national laboratory in the united states also use gpus and matsuoka is recognized as the pioneer of general purpose computing on graphics processing units gpgpu matsuoka explains gpu application there are two ways to improve the performance of supercomputers one is to increase cpu processing speed with increased power consumption and the other is to increase the number of low power consumption cpus although the former method was often employed in the past power efficiency has become more important due to power limits that a facility can provide to a machine therefore i initiated basic research on power efficiency and implemented the technology in the first tsubame however conventional low power cpus reached their limits very quickly especially as machine size increased as such i started basic research on using non conventional processors such as gpus with extreme parallelism and high power efficiency and examined whether they are amenable to general purpose high performance computing on a supercomputer the tsubame series was the first to adopt gpus made by nvidia corporation tsubame utilizes tesla p gpus the professor has always focused on processors with commercial usage rather than custom made cpus gpus had fit that bill but they were not initially meant for general purpose computing after extensive research matsuoka found that gpus would achieve five to six times greater power performance in general high performance computing workloads compared with cpus in terms of computation and memory provided that programming went well although programming was not possible with the first gpus programmable gpus were developed in response to the need for complex computer graphics matsuoka did not miss this he thought that the realization of extreme parallel computing utilizing a large number of gpus would be useful for hpc and could achieve significant power efficiency he started basic research in looking back on that period matsuoka comments hard core supercomputer experts at the time called me crazy also gpu manufacturers themselves told me that gpus were designed and developed for graphics workstations not for supercomputers however for someone who had made computers by himself since middle school and who had thoroughly learned about the principles of computer science at university the application of gpus made perfect sense this is one of matsuoka s strengths he anticipates functions that might be required and starts basic research on them he also emphasizes the importance of shifting from basic to applied research promptly anticipating potential applications and realizing practical use in fact matsuoka made the prototype tsubame available at an early stage and allowed researchers from a wide range of fields to use it enabling the professor to identify various issues during actual operation this approach advanced his research and development this must be the reason i have maintained my position at the leading edge of supercomputer development all these years preparing for the post moore era in years matsuoka is planning to make future generations of tsubame more powerful however he also thinks about the future beyond this computers have greatly improved in accordance with moore s law this has brought qualitative improvements such as those that allow us to watch high definition movies via the internet on our smartphones the innovations in information technology achieved by moore s law are immeasurable however moore s law is nearing its limit in about years we will enter the post moore era now is the time to consider the next method of achieving continued scalability in computing performance otherwise opportunities for disruptive innovations in it will be mostly lost matsuoka mentions quantum computers as one of the methods quantum computers however are not a comprehensive solution we cannot replace most of the existing general purpose computers with quantum computers therefore i am focusing on other computing methods too such as neuromorphic computers and near memory computing computer simulation was based on reductionism reductionism is the segmentation of a phenomenon into smaller elements and observation of the interactions between the elements to understand the entire phenomenon this is like improving the accuracy of simulations through the increase of resolution however after entering the post moore era we can no longer expect further increases in resolution instead of applying reductionism ai and neuromorphic computer concepts attempt to forecast the future by observing and grasping overall phenomena matsuoka continues the idea is to make deductions from data like the human brain does without using simulation this it is argued reduces the amount of computations significantly and increases the processing speed greatly ai and big data play important roles in the deduction from data as seen by deep neural networks of today processing efficiency of ai using neuromorphic principles could further improve the efficiency significantly therefore ai big data and neuromorphic computing will be closely associated in the post moore era one of the reasons that i focused on ai and big data processing in the development of tsubame was to prepare for this era to conclude matsuoka gives young researchers and students the following message power efficiency increasing the processing speed through the utilization of gpus and application of ai and big data processing were all realized after carrying out basic studies for more than years it takes a tremendous amount of time to see concrete outcomes from such research looking back on my experience as a researcher i can say that the most important issue to consider is what you hope to achieve from the research and then work steadily toward that goal so that you arrive ahead of others this is true in all fields of research tsubame abbreviation of tokyo tech supercomputer ubiquitously accessible mass storage environment green while the top project ranks and details the most powerful supercomputer systems in the world every six months based on benchmark speed performance the green project does so based on power efficiency speed performance power consumption tsubame kfc like other supercomputers in the tsubame series tsubame kfc also included gpus to demonstrate power efficiency performance it applied an oil cooling system and ranked no in the world on the green list in november and june processing speed flops flops or floating operations per second is a primary performance index that indicates how many floating point calculations are performed in one second by a given computer giga tera and peta are prefix multipliers and indicate to the ninth billion twelfth trillion and fifteenth quadrillion powers respectively one petaflop therefore is one quadrillion thousand trillion calculations per second moore s law this law states that the number of transistors in dense integrated circuits doubles approximately every to months this was advocated by gordon moore the co founder of intel corporation based on his experience in satoshi

shawn mcglynn bridging disciplines and continents issue associate professor shawn mcglynn earth life science institute five years on from its inception the earth life science institute elsi of tokyo tech launched as part of japan s government funded world premier international wpi research center initiative continues to grow and attract experts in fields ranging from biology chemistry and geology to astronomy and space science their shared goal is to understand how earth was formed and how life began shawn mcglynn joined elsi as an associate professor in specializing in the field of microbial biogeochemistry he tells us more about his research his love of japanese hot springs and how to get involved in activities at elsi an interdisciplinary quest what is your main area of research my basic area of research is the origin and evolution of life at elsi i am able to span a large area of research some of the research i am conducting is entirely chemical but we go all the way from pure chemistry to modern day microbial ecology and big picture biological studies my role here at elsi involves bridging chemistry and biology in order to understand how life works and how it started from a microbiology perspective i think right now is one of the most exciting times because what has been discovered in recent years is that the vast majority of microbial life on earth has not been directly observed yet we are not even sure what the total amount of diversity on the planet is we don t know just how much we don t know it is a time of great exploration and that is why laboratory studies and field expeditions are both extremely valuable for understanding how life works today and how life affects the geochemical cycles of the planet we are living on as well as for thinking about what types of life were present in the past what types of projects are you working on and what kinds of collaborations are important in your studies at the end of august i was co leader of an expedition to a hydrothermal vent in iceland this involved working in a diverse team that includes colleagues from elsi the japan agency for marine earth science and technology and universities in the us together what we will be able to do is answer a whole suite of questions relating to geochemistry microbiology and diversity all from just one expedition this hydrothermal vent an alkaline hot spring is only about meters below sea level you can swim to it by recovering microbes and investigating how they live our study will help not only to supplement our knowledge of current biological diversity but also to reflect on what types of life may have been on the planet in the past the strytan hydrothermal vent which may be similar to vents where life may have started photos courtesy of donato giovannelli d giovannelli twitter strytanexpedition in my collaboration with ryuhei nakamura at elsi we are both interested in understanding how energy flow can structure and organize material that is the biggest question all of my research falls under how is material organized by energy flow while ryuhei approaches this question from the perspective of electron transfer and catalysis i utilize a mixture of chemistry and biology by working together he is able to add a precise electrochemical and material science and a catalysis perspective to my more biochemical understanding and vice versa iron reducing organisms that transfer electrons from metabolic processes to iron or other bacteria in anaerobic conditions how far is it possible to know about the origin of life by studying present day life on earth in a similar way that we don t yet know the current microbial biodiversity of the planet we don t yet know what the first forms of life were like even if we discover all the types of life on the planet and we have perfect knowledge about how they work that doesn t guarantee us the ability to accurately comment on how it started this is because as far as we know life has been on the planet for around billion years it is a long time we don t know at which point in time during those billion years the current tips of the tree of life originated even by using a phylogenetic approach or looking at the last common ancestor of all life on the planet there is no guarantee that that form of life started billion years ago it could have been much later and we don t know if there were some or many other types of life before the type of life we have right now this makes it a truly challenging problem what are your next research goals one of my aims is to understand the nature of electron transfer between individual cells a couple of years ago we discovered what we think is a new mechanism of archaeal bacterial electron exchange we have a strong hypothesis but we haven t conclusively demonstrated that it is correct we are also starting a large project to investigate a class of compounds known as thioesters for the origin of life in collaboration with a number of groups in the us we are starting a project supported by the national science foundation to investigate the geochemistry of ancient thioester chemistry on earth we will try to collect the oldest rocks we can find the oldest minerals in the form of zircons and look for signals of these compounds we will also do laboratory experiments and explore the chemistry in more depth in the group at tokyo tech we will do a combination of protein catalysis evolution and metal sulfide catalysis experiments by covering this ground we might be able to learn about some of the first biopolymers and what they were capable of energetically integrating this with the other team members expertise is truly a great opportunity another component of my research is exploring the microbial diversity of japanese hot springs onsen for example at study locations in nagano and niijima when i came here i realized quickly because i like going to onsen that the diversity of water chemistry in japan is immense from a microbial ecology viewpoint this is enormously helpful because it means we can look at how chemistry is related to biodiversity relatively easily we are focusing on a set of hot springs that are similar to what the ancient oceans might have been like they are full of iron and carbonates maybe similar to the early oceans discovering what types of organisms live there is fascinating and helps us reflect on past ecology with greater certainty iron rich hot spring that may be similar to past locations on earth jinata hot spring on shikinejima close relationships between cells and minerals from an iron oxide environment on the left an image of iron oxides and on the right red cells can be seen scale bar microns photos courtesy of airi idei a one of a kind institute when did you come to elsi i had the opportunity to join elsi in april i had heard about elsi from joe kirschvink a professor at caltech and elsi who invited me to meet with yuichiro ueno who is an elsi pi now yuichiro and i collaborate on a project to relate enzymes and isotopes and it was at this first meeting at elsi where i realized quickly that i could form meaningful collaborations here and work together towards common goals with diverse expertise it s an amazing research environment in your view what makes elsi unique the range of disciplines inside this institute to my knowledge there is nothing else as diverse as this in one single institute elsi has a strong connection with europe and the us where many of the overseas faculty have come from bringing together such a vast amount of expertise we are able to ask three tough questions how did the earth and planets begin how did life begin and now with support through the eon project how did consciousness begin with the opportunities made possible by the wpi program we are free to be as creative as possible and that is unique years ago i received some good advice from a mentor of mine he said i should always make sure i am not the smartest person in the room i think that advice is perfect here at elsi i can always challenge myself by interacting with great minds and that means i can learn something every day from people around me and this helps me carry out more productive experiments one feature of this institute is that we have two large open spaces called the lounge and the agora these open spaces make a huge difference because they encourage people to run into each other casually even when just stopping by for a coffee oftentimes we exchange papers or ideas and those times we have together can be very important this constant knowledge sharing makes me feel like i am in the right place intellectually here at elsi elsi agora nd floor gathering space creative space how can people get involved in activities at elsi we hold the elsi symposium every year which is open by application we also have public lectures then and in general seminars are open to all who would like to attend the next symposium building bridges from earth to life will be held from january to right now elsi is in a spectacular position because we have a budget to fund students and researchers to attend and they also have the opportunity to stay around after the conference this year we are launching the eon elsi winter school a two week opportunity for students to learn about the geology of japan and tour the izu peninsula an area known for its hot springs and also some geological sites of interest as chair of the organizing committee i can say that we also have funding for students to come and join that school nasa has hosted a series of astrobiology summer and winter schools for many years and there s one offered by the nordic network of astrobiology we are trying to create an asian counterpart it is completely international we strongly welcome japanese students as well as other students from anywhere in the world finally what would be your advice to current tokyo tech students interested in learning more about elsi for students just come and visit us in both of the elsi buildings we have large tv screens that scroll through the events taking place it is easy to learn about all of the interesting talks happening here regularly try to learn something new and meet some of the people i am actually now co supervising a graduate student who initially stopped by

yoshiharu tsukamoto design through architectural behaviorology issue professor yoshiharu tsukamoto department of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society integrating existing design theories with the concept of behaviorology when air in a room warms up it rises cold air outside your window causes condensation on the glass such phenomena caused by components obeying physical principles sunlight heat wind and humidity are referred to as natural behavior as people mature and acquire experiences in society they adopt a certain behavior human behavior this behavior or culture develops under specific influences affecting a particular region influences such as weather climate and religion so what is architectural behavior professor yoshiharu tsukamoto defines it as an architectural design theory closely connected to the behavior of nature and people while behavior generally suggests the presence of motion architectural behavior does not for example in areas where strong sunlight creates intense heat buildings will often be equipped with small windows to reduce the effects of this heat these buildings lining the streets create unique cityscapes buildings also transform over time according to changes in society these are architectural behaviors producing sophisticated architectural design requires that we integrate various considerations on a wide range of factors in spite of this the focus of conventional architectural design theories is often quite scattered making it impossible to perceive the building in a comprehensive manner however if we summarize these different components with a single term architectural behavior we can integrate them and begin to see the bigger picture this is why i developed a comprehensive theory that considers design from the perspective of architectural behavior architectural design cannot be realized through architectural sense alone tsukamoto emphasizes that logic is also essential for gaining the empathy of the numerous people engaged in the design phase in order to build something we need to consider design that benefits society something that satisfies people doing so requires not only the design of a beautiful structure but also logic logic allows us to share with society what we have now and where we are going in terms of architecture this logic is provided by architectural behavior implementing the concept into the institute s facilities as an example that incorporates architectural behavior tsukamoto cites the tokyo tech earth life science institute elsi building for which the professor provided the initial design an international base for research in the field of bioplanetology the building was completed in october in the ishikawadai area of ookayama campus it has an exposed concrete finish but also features sliding japanese paper doors although the design evokes a japanese feel tsukamoto emphasizes that it was based on the concept of architectural behaviorology derived from natural and human behavior air pockets created between the sliding doors and windows function as a thermal buffer zone opening and closing the sliding doors allows occupants to control radiant heat transfer from the windows as well as ventilation also this opening and closing adds an element of life to the building viewed from the outside the light glowing from these sliding doors is gentle like the light from a paper lantern and is in harmony with the surrounding residential area windows have been a theme of behavioral study for roughly ten years they bring together natural human and architectural behavior through windows natural components such as light heat wind and humidity interact and reveal different behavior at different times meanwhile human behavior around windows is unique reflecting weather climate and religion when we look at buildings along a street we sometimes see that they all share the same window structure this commonality of window design integrates the variations of the buildings to create beautiful scenery this is what architectural behavior is about tsukamoto and his research group have published three books windowscape window behaviorology windowscape window and the genealogy of streetscape and windowscape windows and workspace all of which summarize field surveys on window behavior both at home and abroad his research group is also engaged in architectural design the elsi building is just one of their projects i think buildings on a campus should function to improve the spaces surrounding them i tried to design a basic structure for the university campus that is different from libraries and halls resembling monuments overseas researchers often spend years at this facility so i designed japanese style rooms in an attempt to provide a unique sense of local hospitality i also designed a spatial structure in which the use of wood increases as we move from the concrete frame towards the interior finishing and windows the parts that people interact with most often elsi building steel reinforced concrete structure with three floors above ground and basement floor first floor hall ideal for seminars workshops and public lectures sliced ore at entrance from lab located at site before elsi construction elsi agora nd floor gathering space with paper sliding doors on windows installing solar panels tsukamoto s research group was also involved in the design of the environmental energy innovation eei building completed in the ookayama north area in february as the name implies the facility is a center for research on environmental energy technology it utilizes a wide variety of systems designed to create and save energy with the goal of reducing co emissions by more than percent compared to average laboratory facilities on campus the greatest building design feature of eei is that the solar envelope fitted with solar panels is designed as a structure separate from the actual building this enables the solar panels to extend to the property boundary and allows tilting of the panels to maximize efficiency all panels are accessible from service catwalks to allow for future replacement a buffer zone is created between the building and the solar envelope warm air in the buffer zone flows upward towards the top of the building helping to keep the panels cool this prevents heat from building up behind the panels reducing the deterioration of power generation efficiency eei building neighborhood landmark with detached solar panel envelope eei building filmed and edited by diego grass p copyright onarchitecture architecture belongs to social reality new topics of research are found not in the laboratory but in communities researchers sometimes discover them in dark unexpected places such as disaster sites one month after the great east japan earthquake a groups of architects established archiaid a disaster relief and restoration support network of which tsukamoto is a founding member thinking that involvement in actual restoration work would be a great educational opportunity the professor asked students in his research group to join recovery projects on the oshika peninsula of ishinomaki city miyagi prefecture they also participated in the restoration of a shrine located in ooyagawahama one of beaches on the peninsula which had served as a symbol of hope for the people in the local community learning from pre industrial revolution trial and error what the group learned from the restoration support activities was a new architectural designing methodology prompting tsukamoto to apply ethnography approaches to his work when for example a client in tokyo asks us to design a building the property budget construction period and program are usually determined along with a myriad of other conditions subject to laws and regulations regarding architecture and urban planning when disaster strikes however the original plans are often lost and we need to start from the basics after listening to the people in the community much like with field surveys in ethnography research this also applies to our study on architectural behavior of windows during which we conducted many field surveys throughout the world i remember feeling that real architectural thought could begin from such surveys since then i have come to think that the ethnography approach to architectural design is truly useful these approaches have also led to an attempt to examine architectural behavior from the viewpoint of ethnography the aim is to study architecture rooted in regional climate and lifestyle and then apply the lessons learned to today s architecture one subject of study is the traditional townhouse or machiya in kyoto kyoto is hot in the summer and cold in the winter it also has a humid climate such conditions influenced the development of a unique housing design that features a living section called ie and a storefront called mise both together on a long deep plot of land with narrow frontage the wisdom applied to the architectural structure of such townhouses is evident in the comfortable living conditions created in the environment available the lattice wall on the street side allows wind to pass through the structure while shading the interior and providing privacy a courtyard in the middle of the townhouse lets in sunlight and allows warm air from inside the building to vent out providing comfort in the summer season environmental control utilizing the lattice and courtyard is both interesting and agreeable when compared with industrialized methods such as the air conditioner in order to avoid design based on facilities and equipment provided by industry it is important for us to learn from the wisdom developed through trial and error by those who lived before the industrial revolution computers do not have such a history however architecture is full of such development i believe it is beneficial for us to apply such wisdom to contemporary architecture naturally both undergraduate and graduate level students in tsukamoto s research group are eager to pursue architectural design while being deeply involved in research that often spills over into design they gradually develop a crucial sense of logic tsukamoto gives all his students the freedom to explore their own research topics within the broad theme of architectural behavior i encourage each student to write a thesis that best represents him or herself why because thinking for ourselves when designing a building is of the utmost importance the principles of behavior guiding tsukamoto the architect undoubtedly illuminate his path as an educator graduate level seminars multicultural discussions over tea buffer zone a space or structure provided to reduce impact of noise vibration or heat envelope exterior structures that wrap a building ethnography historical changes of tangible and intangible phenomena

pham nam hai boosting functionality of semiconductors with spintronics issue associate professor pham nam hai department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering potential of ferromagnetic semiconductor devices while technical innovation in conventional semiconductor technology is approaching its limit an emerging technology spintronics can open new paths to further development in spintronics the spin degree of freedom of electrons is utilized in addition to their charge this will create new semiconductor devices that exceed the limitations of conventional ones associate professor pham nam hai a vietnam native explains in fluent japanese research on spintronics has attracted worldwide attention since its birth in the late s semiconductor materials like silicon which are nonconductive under ordinary circumstances can be modulated to conduct electricity by adding impurities this makes them useful in integrated circuits and optical communication devices in contrast the electron spins when aligned generate magnetic force in ferromagnetic materials this property is applied to hard disks and other non volatile data storage devices meaning they can store information without electric power pham continues semiconductors used in electronic circuits are intermediate between conductors and non conductors an important characteristic that can be used to make electrical switches in contrast the non volatility of electron spins is found in transition metal ferromagnets such as iron cobalt and nickel in other words the electronic circuits that process information and the media that record information are completely different subjects from the viewpoint of materials in order to combine the different characteristics of semiconductors and ferromagnets it is necessary to replace some atoms that comprise semiconductors with atoms that have a magnetic moment and provide magnetic force this creates a new kind of material called a ferromagnetic semiconductor which is the main subject of the field of semiconductor spintronics if ferromagnetic semiconductors come into practical use a paradigm shift in semiconductor technology can happen allowing new high performance and energy saving devices figure combining semiconductor and spintronics technology three obstacles in semiconductor spintronics expectations were high in the early days of research on semiconductor spintronics when researchers found that adding manganese mn to semiconductors resulted in ferromagnetic semiconductors a development that immediately attracted world wide interest when pham entered the field in however there were three big technical and theoretical obstacles to overcome the first was the low curie temperature even if ferromagnetic semiconductors could be fabricated it was difficult to realize ferromagnetism at room temperature ferromagnetism occurred only at extremely low temperatures of minus degrees celsius and below secondly among n and p type semiconductors p type ferromagnetic semiconductors could be made using manganese but n type ferromagnetic semiconductors were impossible the reason for the failure was the insistence on using manganese as the magnetic dopants while providing the magnetic moment manganese atoms also provided a massive amount of holes resulting in p type ferromagnetic semiconductors only as a result the conventional ferromagnetic semiconductors could not even be used to produce diodes the most basic semiconductor devices thirdly the theoretical model considered as the standard model of ferromagnetic semiconductors was unable to explain all their properties because so many researchers had given up further research on ferromagnetic semiconductors i felt this would be a chance for me fortunately since i was engaged in a completely different research topic i did not stick to common beliefs that many researchers in the field shared i revised the standard theory from an outside perspective to identify the reasons why n types could not be made pham points out because i was engaged in research on semiconductors i found it necessary to revise the standard theory therefore i considered a new design methodology to solve those three problems as i started my research in i finally succeeded in making an n type ferromagnetic semiconductor something that did not in theory exist at that time design methodology through trial and error pham speaks as if he overcame the huge problems without breaking a sweat in reality of course he experimented tirelessly in i focused on iron not manganese as the magnetic element to provide ferromagnetism to n type semiconductors iron is electrically neutral in iii v semiconductors which could suppress the generation of massive amounts of holes when added to semiconductors by adding a small percentage of iron to an inas semiconductor i realized an n type ferromagnetic semiconductor for the first time i intuitively thought that i would be able to establish a new design methodology based on my research on semiconductors i was confident that i could achieve the goal if i kept working addition of magnetic iron atoms to semiconductors if successful could produce ferromagnetic semiconductors however there was a possibility of generation of small metal particles in the semiconductor which would mean failure this failure the generation of fine metallic particles in semiconductors was actually the topic of my doctoral dissertation because i knew the conditions required to generate fine metallic particles and their properties i was able to suppress them and make ferromagnetic semiconductors the work pham published in revolutionized the approach to ferromagnetic semiconductors still many researchers rejected it out of hand he pressed forward however and repeated experiments to accumulate results until he proved his approach ferromagnetic semiconductors whose ferromagnetism was only observed at very low temperatures can now operate at room temperature as a result we have entered the phase of device research which includes transistors and sensors in order to be used in computers which generate heat we need to develop ferromagnetic semiconductors that can withstand temperatures degrees celsius higher than room temperature back in no one thought that we would ever come this far i really hope that our efforts toward commercialization of ferromagnetic semiconductors will lead to the creation of compact energy saving computers with high functionality that surpass current computers figure spin transistor using ferromagnetic semiconductor heterojunctions japan s emphasis on basic research pham came to japan in after graduating from a high school in ho chi minh city vietnam while many universities and research institutions in asia particularly in singapore and hong kong were using english for research purposes pham had his eyes set on japan despite not speaking the language he explains i had not studied japanese at all however because chinese characters were once used in vietnam i could understand their basic meaning and so i really didn t have much trouble getting to grips with the language beyond that i really liked physics and wanted to be involved in cutting edge research activities although i thought about studying in france and australia i had high quality electric products made in japan all around me and i felt confident that the country would give me a chance to study at a high level japan also has a year history of basic research in physics of course other asian universities have rapidly advanced but i still believe that japanese universities have an edge in terms of the depth of basic research and education relieving stress through his home made equipment research on semiconductors requires atomic level experiments and the system at japanese universities greatly facilitates such cutting edge research pham s laboratory is equipped with numerous large pieces of equipment he explains in order to be able to conduct experiments we need large equipment that carry a hefty price tag japanese universities however have systems that enable them to work with vendors in order to create new equipment quickly in my case i can purchase parts and assemble equipment with students this helps to reduce costs in fact designing his own equipment for experiments is one way that pham blows off steam working together with students he identifies specifications for specific experimental needs creates designs to meet those needs and actually constructs new equipment by himself this is a way to lift everyone s mood when research stagnates having spent years in japan pham leaves us with two more thoughts there are many excellent students at tokyo tech and other universities in japan if students continue improving their ability to express their own ideas have strong convictions and continue their research with integrity their abilities as researchers will increase dramatically as researchers they must also achieve a high level of english proficiency i always recommend that students use english as much as possible during their research activities although vietnam is a developing economy we do not yet have sufficient human resources i try to talk to students in vietnam every time i return and recommend them to study in japan this is i believe another important role for me as i attempt to contribute to both countries in ways that extend beyond my research spin of electrons electrons have intrinsic angular momentum much like the

takuji yamada early cancer intervention with gut bacteria issue associate professor takuji yamada department of life science and technology school of life science and technology are we more bacteria than human a wide range of bacteria live in the human body there are somewhere in the neighborhood of one thousand different types and some to trillion total bacteria in each of us the number of cells in the human body is trillion so bacteria while being living entities of their own are not foreign substances they are an essential part of us says associate professor takuji yamada a leading researcher of intestinal environments although the influence of these bacteria is not yet completely known it is natural to think that they are somehow involved in all activities within the body because normal bacterial flora account for nearly half of all our cells recently genomic analysis has become a key factor in tailor made medical care while the bacteria in our bodies are not related to our individual genome they replace themselves through continuous replication in addition normal bacterial flora differ in each individual therefore in terms of medical care we need to examine not only the genome but bacteria as well early detection of colorectal cancer through changes in bacteria yamada works to identify bacteria in the large intestine with the hope of making significant progress in realizing a method for the early detection of colorectal cancer normal bacterial flora in the human body total approximately kg and most of these are in the large intestine until recently intestinal bacteria were classified as either good or bad however research has revealed that this kind of classification is too simplistic there are many unknown bacteria whose influence on the body is not yet fully understood therefore i decided to focus on the relationship between intestinal bacteria and colorectal cancer while the major cause of gastric cancer is helicobacter pylori i thought there must be another specific bacteria associated with colorectal cancer the number of colorectal cancer patients is increasing in japan and it is one of the leading causes of death in the country the most common examination for the disease testing for occult blood in stool is cheap but test accuracy is low only about four percent of patients who test positive for occult blood actually have cancer endoscopic examination is more accurate but has not gained widespread popularity because it is expensive and physically invasive yamada felt that looking at bacteria in the intestine may lead to an easier and safer method for early detection recent research results have boosted his confidence research conducted in europe and the u s has revealed that certain bacteria increase in the intestines of progressive colorectal cancer patients and we are now comparing endoscopic examinations and genetic data of the intestinal environment in cooperation with the national cancer center japan and keio university yamada explains early detection of colorectal cancer allows for early intervention which increases the survival rate and significantly reduces physical burden an international consortium involving partners in japan the u s and europe collects data on patients in different countries which may help clarify intestinal environment changes particular to the japanese research on the intestinal environment has progressed in the right direction and i already feel that we are close to realizing success in the early detection of colorectal cancer by utilizing our findings bioinformatics has changed the study of biology bioinformatics an area of science developed through the integration of biology and informatics has played a significant role in the progress of research bioinformatics combines experiments and measurement technology utilizing computers for biological research it was established as an academic field in japan around the year since then yamada has been active at the forefront of the field as with other academic fields the field of biology involves a significant amount of experimentation of course experimentation is always important but high throughput experimental techniques have become more common in the past twenty years and the amount of data obtained from these fundamental experiments is tremendous therefore it was essential to integrate informatics with biology to analyze these colossal amounts of data take for example human genes which are composed of a sequence of dna base pairs linked together like a chain the human genome is composed of over three billion base pairs genomic analysis consists of many techniques one of which is comparison with other genes discovered in organisms it is like looking for letters i e already known genes in a pile of three billion letters analysis requires a method of extracting those letters from the huge pile as explained by yamada bioinformatics starts from the input and organization of obtained data into a database in biology obtaining experimental data has always been key the accumulated data however has grown to a massive three billion letters and analysis and extraction of meaning has become difficult as a result computer analysis has become crucial and thinking has now shifted significantly the focus is less on simply obtaining data and more on how to effectively analyze that data research is done through teamwork but someone must be in the driver s seat to make decisions about the direction of research when a research team is driving their car the driver steers while the passengers serve as navigators or fill other supporting roles in the past researchers in experimental biology were the drivers while researchers in bioinformatics supported research from the passenger seat this was because researchers in bioinformatics had difficulty designing experiments from a biological point of view today however researchers specializing in informatics often sit in the driver s seat and take the initiative with fresh ideas and new perspectives says yamada he continues metagenomics analysis for example is often employed in research on the intestinal environment in my laboratory this is effective in clarifying the characteristics of the intestinal environment of patients with specific diseases all bacteria in the intestinal environment are separated into small sections for analysis of the genetic sequence at this point we don t know which species the gene is derived from the data obtained is the genetic sequence which is rearranged into a genome sequence using a computer somewhat in the way a puzzle is assembled the more genetic information we have the more likely we are to learn which and how many species exist it also allows us to discover characteristics about the intestinal environment through comparison between healthy and unhealthy individuals these ideas are provided by informatics researchers with data analysis techniques they have their own way of approaching biological questions through the wisdom of informatics metagenomic analysis expanding intellectual space yamada focused on the humanities until high school since his kindergarten days however he was also curious about the relationship between thought and body which in the end led him to biology when we want to move our right hand it moves but we cannot move someone else s right hand i was very curious about this what is the relationship between our thought and our body how about other organisms i asked but no one could give me a satisfactory answer with these questions on his mind when entering high school yamada s interests shifted from the humanities to science and he chose to study biology at university since then he has been active in the field and more recently the development of talented individuals who support and build on his research has become one of his top priorities yamada is actively engaged in expanding the field of biology and cultivating next generation researchers within and beyond tokyo tech at the end of the annual conference of the japanese society for bioinformatics held from september to october he held an open lecture to disseminate information on bioinformatics to the general public he also invited high school students to hold presentations on the theme of bioinformatics research years from now yamada was encouraged by what he saw and heard perhaps reminded of his own burning curiosity in high school yamada is now fully involved in providing the younger generation with a chance to consider their own future by urging them to dive in and engage in research if intellectual space is circular then the role of science is to keep expanding this circle i believe that as a researcher i should stand at the circle s edge and continue pushing its boundaries while maintaining an environment in which other researchers can grow and expand too i don t know what we will find as we push these boundaries but i do know that i am very excited about a new future i m sure it will be filled with wonder human bacterial flora genomic analysis a genome is the genetic material of an organism genomic analysis seeks to discover the characteristics of an organism using its genetic information generally the analysis involves comparison with related species tailor made medical care this is also called custom made medical care the purpose of tailor made medical care is to provide the best care for the individual s needs recently individual genomic information is being used to provide care base pair a base pair is a unit consisting of two deoxyribonucleic acids bound to each other by hydrogen bonds the base pair is formed by adenine and thymine or uracil or guanine and cytosine the length of

kazuo nadaoka conserving coral reef ecosystems issue professor kazuo nadaoka department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society coral reefs require urgent action for conservation life on earth has survived billion years of change including forms of life that have become extinct our planet has been home to some million species various biotic communities interact with each other and also with the surrounding environment such an interacting system is called an ecosystem its soundness may not be maintained if the balance in the ecosystem is disturbed by human impacts on it professor kazuo nadaoka and his research group have conducted surveys and research on coastal ecosystems with a focus on their conservation for about twenty years specifically they have surveyed and analyzed ecosystems in tropical and subtropical coastal areas mainly coral reefs with the aim of conserving them from a wide range of environmental threats and feeding their research output back to the local communities which rely on ecosystem services coral reef ecosystems are at greatest risk at the th meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity cbd cop held in nagoya in october participating countries adopted targets collectively known as the aichi biodiversity targets in one of the targets the coral reef ecosystem is specified as an ecosystem requiring urgent conservation action coral reefs are typical ecosystems that indicate their vulnerability to various environmental stresses caused by human activities and climate change nadaoka says global environmental changes and various anthropogenic impacts nadaoka points out that coral reefs in tropical and subtropical zones are threatened by a wide range of complex factors which include not only global scale factors such as climate change but also various local scale human induced environmental issues field survey near ishigaki island okinawa for example coral reef ecosystems in okinawa japan are facing threats of red silt runoff from adjacent land areas and excessive nutrient discharges which are thought to cause outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish acanthaster planci known as typical predators of corals furthermore coral bleaching which results mainly from rising water temperatures has also produced significant damage this phenomenon was damaging to the ryukyu islands particularly in and most recently and have seen the worst coral bleaching in history throughout the world coral is a sessile animal that eats plankton which it catches with its tentacles however this provides only a limited part of the energy required for it to live the remaining part is obtained from photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae which live within the coral tissue bleaching occurs when these symbiotic algae lose their pigment under for example thermal stress caused by high water temperature turning the coral completely white nadaoka explains loss of pigment in the photosynthetic algae means that they are incapable of photosynthesis the nutrients required by the coral are no longer available eventually leading to starvation and death the death of the coral significantly interrupts the entire food chain in the ecosystem the negative impacts are immeasurable the professor continues from the view point of controllability we have to presume that global warming will continue for a few decades and hence the risk of coral bleaching will increase further from this perspective the so called resilience of ecosystems becomes important for ecosystem conservation namely abnormally high seawater temperature in summer which may cause coral bleaching will occur once every few years and even more frequently in the future with this in mind it is of great importance that we consider how to accelerate the recovery of coral reefs after each bleaching event that is how we can increase resilience in order to achieve this it is necessary to reduce local anthropogenic impacts on coral reef ecosystems such as the inflow of red clay and excessive nutrients from surrounding areas unfortunately ecosystem resilience is declining it is therefore our immediate mission to take effective measures to stop this declining trend collaboration with local communities for conservation activities in addition to okinawa nadaoka has established and managed a wide range of projects in other areas of japan and southeast asia with the aim of realizing a sustainable and resilient socio ecological system ses as an effective framework for conservation and restoration including disaster prevention of coastal ecosystems at risk in the science and technology research partnership for sustainable development satreps program jointly organized by the japan science and technology agency jst and the japan international cooperation agency jica to address global scale issues overseas nadaoka as a project leader has facilitated various collaborations with other research institutions with local participants in the cecam project the five year coastal ecosystem conservation and adaptive management under local and global environmental impacts in the philippines cecam project began in based on investigation of the mechanisms maintaining biodiversity of the coastal ecosystems and their changes under various environmental stresses the project developed effective schemes for coastal ecosystem conservation with local community management for controlling environmental stresses and enhancing resilience of coastal ecosystems nadaoka put enormous efforts into implementing the project results in local communities and the central government by holding site based meetings and related activities in these attempts he realized that sharing a sense of crisis among stakeholders based on scientific evidence generated by the project was the key to motivating people to take effective action for ecosystem conservation there is a beautiful beach resort in boracay island which is located in the central philippines the beach however is experiencing severe erosion putting the island s valuable tourism resource at risk our surveys and analyses clarified that excessive development for tourism had damaged the coral reef ecosystem in front of the beach and led to this erosion if profit seeking tourism continues in this way the deterioration of the ecosystem will progress and the beach will disappear in order to enhance local people s awareness about the importance of sustainable tourism development it was necessary to communicate with them by sharing scientific evidence obtained in the project about this causal relationship the cecam project officially ended in february more recently a new satreps project for indonesia and the philippines entitled the comprehensive assessment and conservation of blue carbon ecosystems and their services in the coral triangle bluecares which was adopted in may is now being prepared for full scale implementation around march nadaoka is the principal investigator the project focuses on blue carbon biological carbon sequestrated in coastal marine ecosystems and aims to establish and propose a blue carbon strategy for enhancing local efforts to conserve the coastal ecosystem and improve its resilience thereby contributing to the mitigation of global warming nadaoka comments the benefits we get from ecosystems are known as ecosystem services if we focus on improvement or enhancement of only one aspect among various ecosystem services the soundness of the ecosystem may not be maintained it s far from simple for example increasing the mangroves or seagrass beds may improve the blue carbon function but doing so alone may adversely affect the ecosystem and for example reduce the fish catches in the area an important factor of ecosystem services in the bluecares project we will comprehensively evaluate a wide range of ecosystem services that local societies benefit from and formulate plans that collectively maximize these services after that we can proceed to apply these plans to some local communities as pilot models if we can demonstrate success such plans can then be expanded to other local communities this is what we are aiming to do he continues the coral triangle the target area of the project is located around indonesia and the philippines and has the world s richest ecosystems with high biodiversity unfortunately however various anthropogenic impacts have accelerated their deterioration in addition to corals seagrass beds and mangroves have also been heavily damaged as a researcher i hope to contribute to the establishment of specific measures to realize both effective conservation of the ecosystems and sustainable development of the regions when is research truly complete nadaoka was engaged in physical oceanography and coastal engineering before he started research on conservation of coastal ecosystems after graduating from the master s program in civil engineering at tokyo tech he spent the next five years as a researcher at the port and harbour research institute of the former ministry of transport in nadaoka returned to tokyo tech as an assistant professor as requested by his former academic supervisor professor emeritus mikio hino the turning point however came in his late s in okinawa where nadaoka was dispatched to teach an intensive course on fluid dynamics at the university of the ryukyus i gave the students their final assignment at the end of the course i asked them to write about two water related issues in the okinawa islands i was surprised to find that most of the students brought up the issue of red clay runoff from land into adjacent coral reefs along with water shortages in the islands at that time i had been thinking about the need for integrated approaches combining the study of land and coastal oceans for properly tackling coastal environmental problems i took therefore strong interest in the problems in okinawa inspired by the students nadaoka has today become one of the leading researchers in the search for environmental solutions that reflect both global and local viewpoints he has a message for tokyo tech students the same message he has always given to the students engaged in research with him rather than simply be shown or presented research findings are best used for establishing concrete plans of action towards a sustainable environment and improved society for such plans to ultimately succeed it is also necessary to include people of the community and government in discussions to deepen trust and cooperation and to ensure proper coordination until actual implementation is reached this ability to put findings to practical use is

mutsuko hatano diamonds as the ultimate semiconductors issue professor mutsuko hatano department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering diamonds the ultimate semiconductors while we think of diamonds as very expensive jewelry they can actually be made using methane and hydrogen diamonds are really just carbon a light and simple element their simple yet unique characteristics create significant potential for use in a wide range of purposes including generation of environmental energy and biological applications says professor mutsuko hatano hatano joined tokyo tech with the goal of developing diamond based semiconductors for use in power electronics and sensors diamonds although nonconductive can be altered to function as semiconductors with the addition of phosphorus and boron silicon the most common semiconductor is widely used in memory devices and microprocessors it is also used in power devices as power devices are key for social infrastructure that facilitates smart grids high capacity is required as a result the demand for high capacity power production with minimal loss during power conversion calls for the development of new semiconductor materials the thermal conductivity of diamonds is times greater than that of silicon and electrical field resistance is times greater high thermal conductivity allows the release of heat which can reduce the size of cooling systems normally required during the generation of increased levels of electric power high electrical field resistance suppresses power conversion losses with these characteristics diamonds are the ultimate semiconductors for electronic devices that require several kilovolts kv of power such as those used in electric vehicles railways and power transmission although the formation of diamond based n type semiconductors whose conduction carriers are electrons and p type semiconductors whose conduction carriers are electron holes has been achieved the difficulty has traditionally lain in the formation of the lateral p n junction which is the basic structure of devices collaborating with researchers at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology hatano established a lateral p n junction which was then applied to a junction field effect transistor fet prototype this was the world s first high voltage power device whose application to power supply optimization in smart grids is significantly reducing environmental impact diamond sensor with high potential for biological applications hatano is now focusing on the development of a diamond sensor which has attracted attention around the world due to its potential application to biology in a diamond crystal carbon atoms can be replaced by nitrogen atoms to create nitrogen vacancy complexes nv centers negatively charged nv centers exhibit a magnetic property called electron spin green light radiation causes the emission of red fluorescence depending on the magnetic field fluorescence processes change and magnetic field strength and direction can be detected diamond sensors apply these characteristics and the imaging of a magnetic field is enabled diamond sensors are superior to other sensors because they allow a wider range of spatial resolution from nanometers to millimeters and have a high magnetic sensitivity another outstanding characteristic is that while squid magnetic sensors conventionally require a low temperature diamond sensors operate at room temperature diamond sensors enable scalable application to spatial resolution which is required for the nanometer level analysis of protein structures submicron cell measurement applied to drug delivery and immunological testing and micron level analysis of medical imaging medicines foods and noninvasive measurement hatano wants to address issues in both the dynamic use of diamond sensors in power device semiconductors and the application of diamond sensors at the nanoscale in order to do so she facilitates integration of research in areas such as the life sciences theoretical physics materials sciences and her specialty electronics and electrical engineering and promotes collaboration with overseas researchers massive impact of cooperation in the united states hatano s research on diamonds is an outgrowth of her general interest in science something that was sparked during her early childhood on her fourth birthday she received virginia lee burton s life story from her grandfather this children s story of the history of earth impressed her deeply hatano s parents both have science backgrounds and she often talked with her father about things such as which atoms made up the food they were having for dinner she was also excited by the experiments in her elementary school science class the professor looks back happily on her childhood she says that the educational environment at home and school worked well for her considering japan s need to compete globally in the field of science and technology in order to compensate for its lack of natural resources at hitachi ltd where she was hired after graduating from university hatano was engaged in fundamental research on superconductivity and quantum effect devices for years during her employment she also earned her doctorate she then worked as a project leader in research and development for the commercialization of mobile displays and projects related to environmental energy electronics hitachi sent her to participate in joint research at university of california berkeley ucb for three years in that experience had a great impact on her way of thinking and approach to research her specialty was electronics but she chose to collaborate with a professor specializing in machine engineering through the accumulation of research on heat they deepened their mutual understanding and discovered a new field something that was extremely meaningful for her coming from different backgrounds our discussions had a synergistic effect that led to the establishment of a new field changing specializations and jobs is common in silicon valley through such mobility technology and know how are expanded to a wide range of locations this leads to the establishment of new startup companies hatano says the professor was exposed to a wide range of stimuli living in a different culture when she moved to ucb her firstborn was an elementary school student while her second daughter was in nursery school at that time silicon valley was experiencing its peak period of new startups the elementary school attended by her first daughter had students from over ten different countries reminding hatano that silicon valley was attracting specialists from around the world the infrastructure however was struggling to keep up with the rapid growth in population and schools had reached capacity in an effort to counter this hatano was involved in the establishment of a new elementary school in cooperation with other companies in the region hp inc xerox parc and numerous startups some of the classes were taught by employees from universities nasa and major enterprises my daughter s classmate s mother was a professor at stanford university she dissected a cow s eye for the students which wowed everyone until then my daughters had only had the chance to dissect frogs making that an unforgettable experience for them hatano reminisces opening new doors with scrap and build i came to tokyo tech with a clean slate hatano says the professor moved from hitachi ltd to tokyo tech in july a change she made after deciding to shift her focus to education although her work at hitachi was fulfilling and secure she chose a completely different environment because she dislikes complacency opting instead to follow a scrap and build life at first she felt the stark contrast between private enterprise and university sharing her struggle with students however she was able to show that regardless of the occasional ups and downs anyone could start from zero at any time hatano has a message for tokyo tech students it has become increasingly important to create new and innovative value rather than simply focus on problem solving tokyo tech students should apply their knowledge to the creation of new value and the design of a new society through cooperation with people specializing in a wide range of fields with mutual understanding and cooperative competition things that you simply can t create alone emerge to conclude hatano reveals a secret when producing artificial diamonds for sensors some diamonds become pink we are not exactly sure why this happens naturally colored diamonds are rare and sell for incredibly high prices overseas in a carat pink diamond sold for billion yen i dream of being surrounded by diamonds one day like hatano smiles her research continues electron spin the rotation of charged electrons which can be regarded as a

hirofumi akagi power electronics research with enterprises issue professor hirofumi akagi department of electrical and electronic engineering school of engineering eighty percent of electricity through power electronics by power electronics technology is applied in a wide range of home appliances such as air conditioners refrigerators and washing machines and other important indoor elements such as led and fluorescent lighting a prime example of this technology is the inverter an energy saving system that is among other things used to control the rotation speed of the motor that drives the compressor in air conditioners the inverter plays a key role in power conversion and control systems it converts direct current to alternating current often utilizing semiconductors and is also used to regulate electric power this applies to solar power generation too power electronics converts direct current from the panels to hz alternating current and transmits it to the electric power system says professor hirofumi akagi a man with years of power electronics research experience under his belt power electronics research can be divided into two major areas the development of high speed low loss power semiconductor devices capable of on off switching to achieve efficient electric power conversion and the application of these power semiconductors in components such as power inverter circuits control devices and motor drives akagi is working on the latter an area directly connected to product development conducted by private sector companies power electronics emerged in with the invention of silicon controlled rectifiers thyristors which are semiconductor devices capable of tolerating high voltage and power since then research has resulted in the development of low breakdown voltage high speed semiconductor devices such as mosfets igbts and newly structured high voltage large current semiconductor devices with reduced power loss and increased usability meanwhile control technology utilizing analogue and digital signal processing has also seen remarkable development as a result power electronics technology has found applications in a variety of fields as a fundamental technology that supports modern day lifestyles it drives the development of computer power supplies home and office appliances industrial equipment railways automobiles marine vessels and aircraft as well as power generation transmission and distribution systems akagi continues an american academic association predicts that by percent of the world s electricity will be generated or consumed through power electronics technology this is an extremely important fundamental technology that not only helps to save and create energy but also provides real solutions to global environmental and energy issues large scale machinery worth the arduous effort despite the broad application of power electronics technology in common appliances akagi is now focusing on large scale construction machinery rather than the devices most people are familiar with inverters akagi says are already a component in hybrid vehicles and manufacturers are now actively promoting the electric motorization of construction machinery as well i am working with construction material suppliers on the joint development of mining construction and heavy industrial machinery this is an area that i am very interested in hybrid vehicles require kw inverters super large dump trucks employed in mining require kw inverters these are equivalent to those mounted on shinkansen coaches super large dump trucks have tires that measure about four meters in diameter mounting kw inverters would increase efficiency by one percent and reduce electricity use by about kw the increase in efficiency would also make it easier to cool power electronics devices make devices more compact and reduce the cost of inverter production this is however easier said than done akagi comments the stability and efficiency of high voltage high current power converters may deteriorate with large loads he continues finding a way to improve efficiency is a very interesting challenge for me when dealing with high voltage and current it is necessary to have a sensible power conversion circuit even if the circuit looks complicated however thinking out or identifying a sensible power conversion circuit requires a combination of comprehensive knowledge and creative intuition which come from having fully understood the essentials of power conversion and having gained practical experiences in power conversion it s very much like the strategic board game of go in which we can describe a move as tactically good or tactically bad even if it is patented no one is going to use a tactically bad power conversion circuit this concept of tactics is often difficult for students to grasp it is crucial for them to understand the true essence of power conversion and accumulate relevant experiences it may be due to this dogma that when akagi decides to embark on research partnerships with companies he selects a research topic which requires five to ten years of work companies often look one or two years down the road but very rarely envision the next ten years the reason for this is the tremendous cost of research few companies want to solely take on this burden universities on the other hand can continue research on the same topic as long as they have funding in such cases the cost for companies drops to about one tenth this is what has continuously allowed akagi to conduct joint research with private sector partners a paper plane and rubber band i first learned about power electronics in college but my interest in engineering really started in my childhood akagi reflects on his past he was born and raised in okayama city where his father was working for the japanese national railways living near the station he saw the steam engine locomotives hauling passengers and freight every day on a family trip a glimpse of the newest limited express at kyoto station the kodama series is still a very clear memory akagi smiles as he talks about making rubber band powered planes in elementary school i bent thin bamboo strips in warm water to make a frame and pasted paper on the wings tail assembly and tail fin i sprayed it with water and let it sit overnight so that the paper would tighten and strengthen the frame when i flew it it swooped up then dived down suddenly and crashed i adjusted it here and there trying again and again until it finally flew level and long this was my start in manufacturing becoming more and more enthralled by manufacturing akagi entered the department of electrical engineering at nagoya institute of technology he was interested in electric power and energy including electric motors and generators control theory and electric power system engineering still his main interest was in power conversion circuits and systems it was here that he first encountered the field of power electronics technology and the use of silicon semiconductors to control electric power he was amazed by the fundamental technology used to control torque on the direct current dc motors that drove the kv dc electric railcars in his fourth year in april he joined a research group focusing on power electronics technology this was the beginning of his adventure into research which would become his lifework the p q theory a conundrum solved through reverse thinking a big turning point for akagi was research on the theory of instantaneous reactive power in three phase circuits which he presented at the international power electronics conference in april while working as lecturer at nagaoka university of technology active power consumes electricity in alternating current circuits reactive power does not at universities worldwide active and reactive power are taught in single phase circuits and are then expanded to three phase circuits instantaneous reactive power requires information on past voltage and current which automatically renders it inaccurate because information in the past cannot be instantaneous in the s researchers and engineers working on power electronics technology around the world tried to solve this problem but no one was able to establish a convincing theory akagi thinking in reverse began with three phase circuits to define instantaneous reactive power and utilized formulas to establish its physical meaning akagi explains the definition and physical meaning was consistent with speculation which prompted experts to accept it as valid currently this theory of instantaneous active and reactive power in three phase circuits is called the p q theory as soon as he established the p q theory he applied it to a three phase power conversion system and experimentally verified operating characteristics that had until then been impossible to obtain through the application of the conventional reactive power theory his research paper was published in the july issue of the ieee transactions on industry applications the world s most authoritative journal in the field of power electronics and he gained the admiration of power electronics researchers and engineers worldwide the total number of citations from the conference paper presented in and the transactions paper published in reached a number that continues to increase over years after the two papers were first presented and published power electronics technology in the world s most advanced rail nation after leaving nagaoka university of technology in akagi returned to his hometown as professor at okayama university and spent nine years researching power electronics before joining tokyo tech where he had taken his master s and doctoral degrees he took over the laboratory where he had carried out research as a graduate student looking back akagi says that he felt a deep sense of responsibility and mission as he does today the research environment at tokyo tech is excellent our power electronics lab is directly related to manufacturing and provides students a wide range of opportunities to experience modeling analysis simulation experimental device design and production data measurement and characteristics evaluation which cover the requirements of engineering research and are useful for research and development at both companies and universities after graduation tokyo tech is also proud that its education and research paradigm focuses not only on the experimental aspect but also on the theoretical one tokyo tech s strength lies in providing a research environment that combines know how technology and advanced equipment i hope more students are able to take full advantage of these benefits the institute has excellent students from overseas who promote interactions beyond the boundaries of culture some have acquired doctoral degrees and passed the most advanced japanese language proficiency tests as a result they have been hired by japanese companies and bear core responsibilities in the research and development of power electronics japan leads the world in power electronics technology the driving force of which has been the nation s advanced railway system a source of childhood fascination for the professor this attraction appears undiminished with his eyes on the future akagi feels that

keisuke suzuki synthesis of natural organic compounds issue professor keisuke suzuki department of chemistry school of science frontline of research on total synthesis of natural organic compounds it is hard to imagine today s world without the medicines that keep us healthy or the plastic products that bring convenience to our everyday lives despite their diversity these products called organic compounds share the feature of a carbon skeleton making up their backbone in addition to itself carbon also bonds easily with elements such as hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen making the number of potential organic compounds formed through the combination of these elements infinite except for water and minerals our bodies are composed mostly of organic compounds with the sixty trillion cells in each of us surrounded by nucleic acids proteins carbohydrates and fats working in concert to maintain life when this harmony is disturbed illness usually results in the past our ancestors sought cures in their natural environment they found through experience that natural organic compounds in animals plants and microorganisms had special qualities and benefits the problem was that many of the most effective ingredients of these were rare in nature and hard to come by in today s world the artificial synthesis of organic compounds is commonplace but this was not the case before the late nineteenth century it wasn t until that german chemist friedrich w hler accidentally discovered that an organic compound urea was produced when he heated an inorganic compound ammonium cyanate in a test tube this marked the birth of artificial organic synthesis and the beginning of a new area of science today organic compounds artificially produced from coal and petroleum fabrics and highly functional materials such as organic electroluminescence materials are indispensable in our daily lives added to these are the numerous designed and synthesized pharmaceuticals inspired by the structure of natural organic compounds according to professor keisuke suzuki there is a fine line between a drug and a poison and it is often the case that natural organic compounds are both bioactive and toxic if we change the molecular structure however we can increase bioactivity and decrease toxicity take ivermectin for example a compound discovered by nobel prize winning japanese biochemist satoshi omura its discovery made it possible to prevent blindness caused by onchocerciasis a parasitic disease affecting millions in africa ivermectin was developed by hydrogenating avermectin a product of microorganisms in soil samples collected in shizuoka prefecture this massive potential is what makes organic synthesis so attractive examples of synthesized natural organic compounds while the above modification of natural product structures is called relay synthesis there is another distinct approach known as total synthesis starting from scratch that is with simple easily available materials researchers seek to synthesize compounds with complex structures via a number of reactions a process called multistep synthesis the synthesis of compounds with complex structures requires the selection of suitable starting materials the application of appropriate reactions in the appropriate order and the selective cleavage and recombination of chemical bonds all of which present quite a challenge suzuki sought to meet these challenges as a pioneer in the field of organic synthesis there are two major facets of organic synthesis research the development of reactions utilized in synthesis and the strategic planning to combine synthesis reactions in terms of the former suzuki developed innovative methods for the construction of carbon skeletons and stereocontrolled synthesis utilizing chemical species with high reactivity such as benzyne and nitrile oxide in terms of the latter he successfully achieved a wide variety of syntheses targeting the hybrid structure of natural organic compounds in which structural complexities derive from different biosynthetic pathways such as carbohydrates terpene biological material produced by a variety of plants insects and fungi and polyketides organic synthesis is like working a puzzle suzuki says that organic synthesis is like working a jigsaw puzzle imagining the completed form of the compound he wants to create suzuki then takes the pieces apart in his brain designs a combination of pieces and rebuilds the structure this is not however as easy as it sounds in order to construct a complete compound three elements are essential of primary importance is the design of the basic skeleton as mentioned organic compounds consist of carbons however these carbons have a wide range of structures higher fatty acids such as linoleic acid have a linear chain structure while steroids have a multi cyclic structure the first step in the synthesis of compounds is to understand the basic skeleton of the molecules to be produced and search for a method of construction the second important element is that of functional groups functional groups are specific clusters of atoms attached to the carbon chains that are responsible for chemical reactions and provide chemical characteristics to specific molecules organic molecules can be compared to fish where carbon skeletons are the fish bones and their functional groups are the fish meat the third important element is stereochemical control suzuki explains this using the flounder as an example some flounders have eyes on the left side of their heads while others have them on the right flounders are similar but completely different he says which makes them wonderfully analogous to our research if we want to make a flounder with eyes on the left side we need to make a structure specific to that left eyed species and add some meat to complete the body the key to successful synthesis is the combination of three elements creating carbon skeletons arranging functionalities and controlling stereochemistry three elements of synthesis it sounds easy but there are many difficulties in the process of synthesis teruaki mukaiyama suzuki s mentor at the university of tokyo focused on the development of new reactions because he saw this as the way to produce something from nothing he complimented this with synthetic studies which he saw as the way to apply results from the new reactions to other bigger possibilities this thinking motivated suzuki to pursue the development of reactions he was also secretly looking into synthetic studies which at the time were unrelated to his graduate work his experience in both fields however boosted his research work after he accepted a position at keio university in reality reactions and syntheses are two sides of the same coin which means that we need both in our research it is really just like mountain climbing the development of reactions is like the preparation for the climb while making synthesis plans is like selecting a route it takes good equipment and the right route to make it to the top suzuki mentions another challenge that needs to be overcome before the summit of the mountain can be reached molecules with complex structures have strong characteristics and are hard to manipulate returning to our analogy of mountain climbing it s like we are facing an obstacle preventing us from making the final push to the summit i have experienced such obstacles in my work and have broken through in research just as in mountain climbing reaching the peak is the greatest reward the challenge lies in the acquisition of pure compounds natural organic compounds with complex structures are chemically unstable and often hard to purify due to their special characteristics in addition if the target compounds are water soluble everything becomes even harder in terms of synthesis and final purification this interferes with the synthesis of natural organic compounds with complex structures which is a challenge for the future nature is testing us many molecules that play specific roles in nature have attractive structures we aim to produce such molecules through organic synthesis although nature has no difficulty in creating such molecules we are forced to endure the process of trial and error we sometimes feel that nature is testing us it is this difficulty that appeals to me every day is a new intellectual challenge suzuki who is now engaged in the synthesis of safflower pigments and antibiotics says in suzuki s research was recognized with the japan academy prize i was deeply honored to receive such a prestigious award even though i have not yet reached my goal this award has motivated me to exert even more effort in my work he says suzuki always keeps in mind the slogans of his mentor mukaiyama the deeper you dig with faith the newer you find and honesty cheerfulness passion he also clearly recalls the words of another mentor in his second hometown dieter seebach professor emeritus at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich one can certainly plan research but not the results i focus on curiosity driven research says suzuki research that goes as planned does not mean it is successful we conduct research partly in the hope of finding something new even if our research does not go as smoothly as planned i want students to learn the fundamentals but i also want them to establish innovative hypotheses and develop their own research don t be afraid of mistakes from unexpected results emerges new value friedrich w hler w hler discovered crystalized urea by chance while heating ammonium cyanate he showed that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic compounds stereocontrolled synthesis an asymmetric carbon atom is attached to four different substituents the four substituents can be arranged in space in two different ways that are mirror images of each other isomers which leads to the creation of so called left handed and right handed versions of the same molecules a compound with n asymmetric carbon atoms has n isomers diastereoisomers which are hard to separate however chemical reactions have recently enabled us to develop a method of acquiring the necessary isomers this is called stereocontrolled synthesis polyketides polyketides are compounds with cyclic structures that are produced by certain living organisms they comprise a wide range of complex compounds produced when acyclic ketone is synthesized from acetyl coa and malonyl coa many pharmaceutical products and agricultural chemicals are derived from polyketides teruaki mukaiyama mukaiyama has been engaged in the development of a wide variety of unique organic compound reactions including the mukaiyama aldol reaction recipient of the

kenji nogami predicting volcanic eruptions with chemistry issue professor kenji nogami department of chemistry school of science volcanic fluid research center what if another large volcanic eruption occurs in japan what happens when a volcano erupts in japan asks professor kenji nogami at the volcanic fluid research center in kusatsu gunma prefecture the great taisho eruption at sakurajima kagoshima prefecture in was the largest volcanic disaster that japan encountered in the th century the spread of volcanic ash was reported as far away as chichijima ogasawara miles to the southeast and sendai miles to the northeast an equally large eruption could happen in japan at any time ash from volcanic eruptions overseas has been known to reach the stratosphere and ash from large eruptions in japan can rise to more than meters that is enough to cover the whole japanese archipelago such eruptions have a serious impact on transportation air traffic is grounded due to severely decreased visibility and the very real risk of accident due to high temperature ash clogging plane engines something that actually happened to a over indonesia in ash can also shut down expressways and rapid rail lines such as the shinkansen when traffic networks are interrupted supply chains are affected and the delivery of food and other important commodities is delayed some experts predict that mount fuji will erupt sooner or later and there are numerous other volcanos in japan that may erupt and throw communities and regions into turmoil chemistry the key to predicting volcanic eruptions the eruption of mount ontake in september is still fresh in people s memories the total number of dead or missing reached that disaster was exacerbated by the type of eruption nogami explains the impact of phreatic explosions eruptions caused by phreatic explosions are much more difficult to predict than those caused by magmatic explosions in a magmatic explosion high temperature magma flows into rock crevices which causes an earthquake swarm ground transformation and expansion of the volcanic body in terms of chemical conditions the composition and emission of volcanic gas change in a phreatic explosion magma is not directly involved instead volcanic gas and the steam generated by it cause the explosion it is however extremely hard to know where and how much steam has accumulated and preceding phenomena are also weak and infrequent the mount ontake eruption was a phreatic explosion while the scale was not large it occurred at the worst possible time just before noon when climbers were sitting down to eat their lunch on a fine saturday in fall that increased its impact greatly although phreatic explosions are difficult to predict nogami says a method for doing just that is in sight there are three approaches to volcano monitoring the first is geophysical observation the most traditional method it involves the observation of real time physical changes such as earthquake waves ground transformation such as expansion of mountains and changes in magnetism utilizing a global navigation satellite system gnss and clinometers most active volcanos are constantly monitored in this way the second is geological observation this involves evaluating volcanic potential by estimating and analyzing the form and scale of past eruptions through petrological geological and mineralogical survey of the amount and dispersion of ejecta and the chemical composition of lava the third is geochemical observation nogami s specialty volcanic activity is the emission of energy and matter whose change can be monitored by continuously measuring the chemical composition of various gases lake water and other substances volcanic gas consists mainly of steam and other components such as sulfur dioxide so bisulfite h s and carbon dioxide co obtaining samples from a mixture of these components requires plenty of experience and special technology but because volcanic gas travels fast monitoring and quick assessment of subsurface conditions is possible for several years prior to the eruption of mount kusatsu shirane in mizugama former tokyo tech professor joyo osaka and members of his research group monitored changes at the site through geochemical observation the observations allowed his group to predict a phreatic explosion for the first time in the world using this method abnormalities were also detected three months prior to the eruption of unzen fugendake in which allowed warning of the potential eruption to be given a syringe with two mouths is used to collect volcanic gas while geophysical observation can detect volcanic activity it is still difficult to understand whether magma is involved or to ascertain the current condition of a volcano chemical analysis of the ejecta however makes it possible to monitor specific changes in volcanic activity in other words we can explain whether the volcano will become more active or settle down nogami explains that integrating geography physics and chemistry allows us to better understand volcanic activity an active volcano is defined as one having fumarolic activity or that has erupted within the past years there are active volcanos in japan of which have been designated for monitoring by the coordinating committee for prediction of volcanic eruptions which nogami is a member of these are constantly monitored by the meteorological agency of japan among them the observation and research of active volcanos are prioritized however only few national universities including tokyo tech kyoto university and kyushu university are involved in the project to make matters worse a lack of leading researchers looms in the near future the tokyo tech volcanic fluid research center has joined forces with the volcano disaster management council of kusatsu town in gunma prefecture where mount kusatsu shirane is located and representatives from other prefectures such as iwate and toyama to promote cooperation and information sharing unfortunately the volcanic fluid research center suffers from a staffing shortage volcano disaster management has three major pillars observation prediction and action the volcanic fluid research center has a volcano observatory that enables us to conduct research utilizing a wide variety of data in cooperation with the meteorological agency we base our predictions of volcanic activity on this data and information one result of this research has been that gunma prefecture and kusatsu town have built a shelter at mount shirane that can accommodate people because the main objective of predicting volcanic eruptions is to save lives such projects should be promoted in other areas as well the problem though is the declining number of individuals going into this area of research volcanos are active everywhere in japan even when they are not erupting we need to work together in training more young researchers to prevent a critical shortage of manpower in volcano prediction research and disaster control the importance of monitoring submarine volcanic activity in japan volcanos are not found only on land but also in the seas around japan tokyo tech has conducted a wide array of research in cooperation with the japan coast guard for more than half a century in places as far away as the ogasawara archipelago and ryukyu islands it has been years since nogami took over oceanic volcano observation from professor osaka who first became nogami s mentor during his days at okayama university chemical analysis is essential in monitoring submarine volcanos collecting samples is difficult however because it requires a special vessel for this reason we can only collect samples on certain occasions what we usually do instead is look at the characteristics of the area and coloration on the ocean surface from the air the ocean surface above the crater of a submarine volcano becomes muddied as a result of volcanic activity this is caused by the sedimentation of elements via the neutralization of alkali in the seawater and acid contained in the hot water gushing out from the submarine volcano the result is called discolored seawater nogami points out that the unique research tokyo tech has carried out opened the way to ascertain the state of a submarine volcano using only photos and surface samples when a submarine volcano around el hierro at the west end of the canary islands in the atlantic ocean erupted in the fall of nogami and his co researchers at the site monitored the conditions and consulted with local government officials the problems resulting from submarine eruptions differ from terrestrial eruptions but both can have a significant effect on human activity japan has volcanic islands that are home to approximately residents if one of these volcanos should erupt residents can be evacuated however it is more difficult to determine if and when they can return to the island submarine volcanos also have the potential to affect shipping if the pumice stones ejected from volcanos get caught up in the engine cooling systems of tankers and cargo vessels serious problems can result volcanic ash can interfere with radar and gnss new land masses generated by submarine volcanic activity create issues related to territorial rights and exclusive economic zones which means that submarine volcano research is directly connected to national interest working in the field will broaden your views field work at sessho gawara mount kusatsu shirane kusatsu home of the volcanic fluid research center is famous for hot springs many may not know that the town is truly an eco city because it utilizes volcanic activity to its advantage daily the abundant hot spring water generated by the volcanic activity of mount shirane not only supplies the resort baths that tourists visit but is also used together with a heat exchange system to supply hot water to households for more than years hot spring water running in pipes installed under most roads have been used to melt snow there is no other town in japan which takes such advantage of the benefits of volcanos nogami spends most of his time each year in the mountains of kusatsu smiling he says that he is more comfortable being outside than in the laboratory when he was a child he was always at home reading he read all the books in the library at his elementary school his parents were very worried and decided to have him join the boy scouts this started his lifelong interest in nature and he continues to be a boy scout leader to this day you never know what will be a turning point in your life he says nogami also has a message for students who are studying science and engineering try to broaden your view look at things from a wider perspective in order to do so it is necessary to go out and observe get out of the virtual world of the lab working with actual objects is essential in all fields of research while this does not always have to be outdoors you need to see touch and observe you should be willing to reach out and explore such experience increases your motivation to improve your skills and deepen your insight volcanic fluid research center because the world s first successful geochemical prediction of a phreatic explosion was the result of observations at mount kusatsu shirane the kusatsu

shinae kondoh optical imaging to detect cancer cells issue professor shinae kondoh department of biomolecular engineering graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology developing optical imaging systems for detecting hypoxic cancer cells cancer has been the primary cause of death in japan since claiming lives in alone it has become a national disease attacking one in two people one in three of whom dies as a result more optimistically though cancer is no longer an automatic death sentence medical advances mean early diagnosis and treatment can even allow patients a full recovery whereupon a new challenge emerges how to pinpoint the location and state of cancerous cells to treat them effectively some scientists are tackling this challenge using the latest biotechnology for new examination and cure methodologies professor shinae kondoh who joined the graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology in has been one such pioneering researcher bioluminescence imaging of cancer cells in a metastatic cancer mouse model the color reflects the number of cancer cells the highest density appears in red and the lowest density appears in blue cancer refers to the formation of malignant cells due to genetic damage once formed cancerous cells proliferate like wildfire and unlike normal cells are uncontrollable by biological functions it is virtually impossible to prevent and eradicate such cells mainly due to multiple unidentifiable factors involved in the genetic damage mechanism this is further exacerbated by the way the cancer functions it exploits normal tissue and cells such as blood lymphatic vessels and macrophages white blood cells to form a cancer microenvironment while rapidly multiplying such environments can create excellent markers to specify the affected locations but remain highly elusive when conventional analysis methods are used in response kondoh has developed an in vivo imaging system capable of monitoring the quantity and activity of intratumoral hypoxic cancer cells precisely and in real time while leaving normal cells unscathed the optical imaging system uses fluorescent probes comprising near infrared fluorescent dyes and bioluminescence reporters artificially introduced to cancer cells since the fluorescent probes are selectively accumulated in hypoxic cancer cells and the reporters express an enzyme luciferase which produces bioluminescence only in hypoxia hypoxic cancer cells can be visualized by fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging respectively mechanism of hypoxic cell specific imaging probes using optical in vivo imaging techniques on a small animal such as a mouse enables visualization of not only the location size and spread of cancerous cells but also the status of their activity at the cellular level which is crucial for monitoring the effect of new medicine tested on cancer cells several issues such as limited observation depth remain before clinical application but diagnosis equipment that utilize optical systems are actively being developed worldwide and will greatly facilitate early cancer detection and treatment in the near future aiming to conquer hypoxic cancer cells the determinative characteristic of cancer cells something normal cells lack is their ability to survive even in a hypoxic microenvironment where the level of oxygen normally required by living organisms to produce energy is limited hypoxic regions located far from blood vessels are also deprived of nutrition cancer cells in the hypoxic regions make every effort to survive in such a severe microenvironment such as by suspending division to save energy and moving to a better microenvironment they also rapidly resume proliferation once oxygen and nutrition levels improve kondoh cites such hypoxic cancer cells as a major obstacle to leading cancer treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy radiation therapy is highly rated and can be the first choice for many patients outside japan its biggest advantage is that it pinpoints affected areas while being non surgical and non invasive but its major downside is its limited effectiveness against hypoxic cancers hypoxic cancer cells are less sensitive to radiation because oxygen introduced during treatment enhances the damaging effect known as the oxygen effect many anticancer drugs target actively dividing cells and are less effective on hypoxic cancer cells remaining in a state of suspended proliferation hypoxic cancer cells have been a major stumbling block for effective cancer therapies sensing a potential breakthrough kondoh currently researches pharmaceutical products targeting hypoxic cells optimal drug delivery systems and the prevention of malignant transformation projects include developing cheap target binding peptides which can replace antibody drugs creating an efficient drug delivery system searching for new drug targets and revealing mechanisms of metastasis highly resistant to anticancer therapies and with a self sustained ability to survive hypoxic cancer cells are like the root of all evil detecting and eradicating them at an early stage can surely save many lives regardless of the cancer type love for research paved the way kondoh s childhood experience of being helped through constant illness by medicine gradually shaped her dream of developing medical drugs and led her to a pharmaceutical university after graduation kondoh opted to learn immunopharmacology at graduate school only to find the lab door tightly closed to women the classrooms as well as the labs were closed to me she reminisces with a smile so after casually watching a tv program on immunotherapy in the u s kondoh made a quick decision to enroll at a medical school in new york she received a one year scholarship from the rotary foundation which helped her cover daily expenses and tuitions fees immunology was the popular course at the time so kondoh eventually opted for immunovirology instead this decision prompted her to specialize in tumor virology at graduate school once back in japan the immunovirology course in the u s was related to vaccine development research which differs from the cancer research in which i m currently involved anyway i was tried and tested in a harsh environment with no special privileges for foreign students with substandard english proficiency anyone getting a c the lowest score on the evaluation scale was immediately expelled from school despite the challenges kondoh extended her u s stay by two years completing the master s program in microbiology and immunology upon returning to japan she established cancer research as her specialty at osaka university s graduate school of medicine after obtaining a doctoral degree she considered joining a company but was again discouraged by a comment heard at the company s employment test even women with doctoral degrees would be rated no more highly than junior college graduates determined to dedicate her life to research her passion she joined a team named okayama cell switching project owned by the research development corporation of japan and led by hiroto okayama her mentor and then researcher at osaka university since then her efforts have centered on research at universities including kyoto university where she spent time before coming to tokyo tech kondoh didn t ignore her private life either during her years of intense research she married and had two children who were entrusted to a nursery on campus when the nursery later faced the crisis of closure due to the retiring childcare workers and small number of children three at the time kondoh took the initiative to find childcare workers in person so it could remain open i did it because i had to i was so busy that i couldn t even take pre or post maternal leave i was involved in an experiment until the day my babies were born she said with a laugh her efforts paid off and today the nursery is a refined and well managed facility carefully defining personal aptitude for the future even after numerous tests and trials in her advanced research to challenge the modern day national disease family life and childcare kondoh s facial expression betrays not the slightest hint of previous hardship when recounting the story it seems she enjoyed the struggle and therein lies her strength her message to students is more enthusiastic than the words that describe her research university life is more about what you do in the process rather than the results you achieve once your learning has finished the next step is to test your determination to see if you can push through the path you chose don t choose the easy job or because there are many positions available use your time at tokyo tech to examine your aptitude and reflect on things repeatedly until you are absolutely sure there is no room for later regrets to do so fully absorb what you can learn now and march straight on in the path in which you believe horizontal collaboration transcending research fields is crucial for cancer research according to kondoh tokyo tech is a dream come true research venue with many front runners in materials information and machinery research all of which are indispensable to new medical development research the day when her ceaseless and insatiable endeavor bears fruit may be close at hand statistics sourced from

ryoji kanno canning energy with all solid state batteries issue professor ryoji kanno department of electronic chemistry interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering improved battery performance and diversification to keep apace with device advancement amidst the non stop production and consumption of energy all around us batteries function as practical sources of canned energy that can be accessed when needed for many the word brings to mind disposable dry cell batteries primary batteries which can come in the form of low cost manganese longer lasting alkaline or higher efficiency lithium types when introduced lithium batteries quickly found wide application and today power our watches cameras and calculators the advent of the lithium ion battery brought added convenience to people s lives lithium ion batteries are rechargeable or secondary batteries that make use of carbon and other materials to store lithium ions in addition to improving device function these compact high power cells contributed significantly to the reduction in device size and weight used in mobile phones and laptops since lithium ion batteries are also widely applied in hybrid and electric automobiles as development continues the importance of lithium ion batteries is increasing in leaps and bounds i could have never imagined how much lithium ion batteries would contribute to society when i first started research on lithium in professor ryoji kanno has spent more than years synthesizing the inorganic materials that are essential in improving battery performance in addition to the development of lithium cells kanno s research group is currently working on the enhanced functionality of solid oxide fuel cells which are gradually gaining popularity as home use fuel cells and the development of energy conversion systems based on an innovative new concept the group s multifaceted approach to the creation of materials is bearing fruit currently kanno is mainly focusing his energy on the development of all solid state batteries which have undoubtedly overturned existing conventions commercialization of all solid state batteries as goal over years have passed since alessandro volta invented the battery in however present common knowledge about primary and secondary batteries may soon be a thing of the past the key to this revolution lies in the electrolytes that conduct electric current electrolytic solution is a core component of commercially available batteries high performance lithium batteries apply organic solvent for this purpose organic solvent however is combustible creating safety concerns the all solid state batteries being developed by kanno replace organic solvent with solid material significantly improving safety while making it possible to handle larger amounts of electricity the travel distance of an electric automobile utilizing this type of battery for example can be increased from km to km on a single charge a more compact design is also possible as all solid state batteries do not require the safety devices required for organic solvent solidity reduces combustibility and increases safety furthermore all solid state batteries function over a wide range of temperatures and easily pass current to provide increased power quick recharge is also a feature while all solid state batteries have great merits their one disadvantage is in initiating a contact because unlike organic solvent contact requires an interface if we can solve this problem the goal of commercialization will be within reach finding the best material to initiate contact was the key to a new chapter in the history of batteries amidst the fierce competition that takes place in the world of material development kanno was the first to identify the right one in a research group composed of kanno and colleague masaaki hirayama associate professor at tokyo tech toyota motor corporation and the high energy accelerator research organization kek created the world s first lithium superionic conductor li gep s capable at room temperature of conducting lithium ions faster in solid state than in liquid state this lithium superionic conductor exhibits twice the conductivity of existing lithium ion conductors and ionic conductivity that surpasses organic solvent the electrolyte used in existing lithium ion secondary cells needless to say this discovery accelerated the development of all solid state batteries the incombustibility and safety together with increased conductivity were key elements in the commercialization of electric automobiles and the improvement of hybrid vehicle performance and caused excitement in the world of next generation high energy density battery research in the battery related world the most significant change after mobile phones and computers will be seen in automobiles along with innovations in transportation it is necessary to develop an alternative to fossil fuels with an eye on power safety stability and eco friendliness i believe that we as materials experts need to realize the potential of rechargeable batteries as that alternative this is our chance to show our knowledge and ability breakthrough with knowledge from different fields researchers involved in materials development often call themselves materials experts or synthesis experts kanno s background as a researcher however is not in materials synthesis only after studying inorganic materials synthesis methods such as high pressure synthesis at osaka university kanno moved to the electrochemistry laboratory at mie university to conduct research on lithium in although kanno s doctoral thesis was on lithium ion conductors mie university was the starting point for the research that led to solid battery development following this he moved to kobe university it was here that he met professor yoji kawamoto a well known researcher of the optical properties of glass although from a different field kanno was influenced by kawamoto s views and methods his experience with kawamoto led to the development of a thin film fabrication method one of the material research methods that kanno and his laboratory staff are fascinated with in kanno joined tokyo tech where he continues his research on the border of materials synthesis and electrochemistry our laboratory has grown to more than staff members and students we have seen definite progress in each area of research materials development solid batteries thin film synthesis and improvement of fuel cell performance i feel it is soon time to reap what we have sown we continue to further our high quality research on materials creation which may well bring a few surprises to the world seeking results in your field of interest leads to satisfaction materials development can take ten years while commercialization may require another ten or twenty the development of rechargeable batteries too has been an exercise in true commitment and perseverance due to kanno s extraordinary efforts in the past his message to current tokyo tech students carries great weight i believe that following your interests is of paramount importance in achieving results setting your goal is the first step once it is set you must wholeheartedly continue moving toward it these two elements are the keys to success if your position and environment allow you to work towards your goal then you have already achieved a certain happiness my experience tells me that this is true kanno describes his own goal as contributing to society through the development and commercialization of rechargeable batteries utilizing the materials he has created in addition to unleashing personal happiness the realization of products packed with the spirit and conviction of researchers like kanno brings joy and contentment to the lives of others explanations of technical terms solid oxide fuel cells high efficiency home use fuel cells which generate electricity through the chemical reaction of oxygen and hydrogen with exhaust heat used to boil water also known as sofcs alessandro volta february march italian physicist known as the inventor of the electrical battery utilized zinc and copper as electrodes and water with either sulfuric acid or sodium chloride as electrolysis solution organic solvent organic chemical compound capable of dissolving substances such as ethanol benzene and chloroform which are normally insoluble in water liquid state at ordinary temperatures and pressures high pressure synthesis synthesis method that involves heat treating raw ingredients under gigapascal level pressure gpa pa in a sealed pressure medium the difference in compressibility between the positive and negative ions of constituent elements or transfer to high density phases makes it possible to synthesize superconductive materials that cannot be synthesized under normal pressure thin film fabrication method kanno hirayama laboratory succeeds in growing a crystal on the top of a single crystal substrate epitaxial growth and synthesizing a thin film used for solid battery and lithium ion battery experiments ryoji kanno

osamu ishitani seeking photocatalysts for chemical energy issue professor osamu ishitani department of chemistry graduate school of science and engineering photochemistry chemical reactions by light photochemistry refers to a branch of chemistry where reactions are triggered by applying light not heat as the energy source in response to the absorption of light one compound transforms into another in a reaction based on changes in its atomic bonds the interesting fact is that thermal and photochemical reactions can often derive completely different products from identically structured compounds attracted to the mysteries of photochemistry many global researchers including myself have performed countless research activities in the field expressing his fascination at the infinite potential of photochemistry professor osamu ishitani s eyes shine he is a researcher with more than three decades of experience in artificial photosynthesis a promising science often contrasted with solar energy based biological photosynthesis energy resource shortage is a serious problem for modern society as a result there are high expectations for photochemistry in various areas including solar fuel synthesis despite now being in the spotlight photochemistry studies originally started with a completely different focus according to ishitani the origins of photochemistry research date back to the late s since then the idea that light would produce different compounds from heat has spawned vigorous attempts to apply it to various compounds and study the results an intense adolescent experience despite originating out of curiosity the path to photochemical research swayed toward solar fuel synthesis following the two oil shocks which threatened global society in the s amid a sudden impending sense of crisis academic business and governmental sectors recognized that fossil fuels such as oil and coal would not provide limitless energy my family ran a business selling daily necessities wholesale and the oil shock hit us hard soap and other oil based products soon ran out and calls from our retailers insisting on supplies made daily life a huge challenge i vividly recall a tense sometimes menacing atmosphere after graduating from high school ishitani chose to study chemistry at kobe university he attributes his choice to his love for chemistry but also the vivid memory of the energy crisis something that motivated him on the path to photochemistry one day as a th year undergraduate student he stumbled across a magazine article on the process of converting light to chemical energy and the idea grabbed him immediately at this time the topic of conversion of light energy to chemical energy was becoming increasingly popular the article was written by professor zen ichi yoshida of kyoto university concerning the potential to solve the energy crisis with a purely chemical approach i was very impressed with this and i knew instantly that this was the only path for me laughs many obstacles lay ahead but the article had well and truly captured his imagination from kobe ishitani moved to osaka university an institution with a photochemistry lab and met doctor chyongjin pac a world photochemistry authority and mentor ishitani consolidated and fine tuned the fundamentals taught by the doctor through activities at the hahn meitner institute in germany the national research institute for pollution and resources of the agency of industrial science and technology presently the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology the university of north carolina at chapel hill the university of nottingham and saitama university at tokyo tech ishitani currently engages in developing highly efficient photocatalysts photocatalysts and three issues facing humanity as concern over the increase in global warming intensifies the view that fossil fuel consumption must be minimized is becoming increasingly strident however i see another key problem the depletion of carbon based materials such as organic compounds and synthetic polymers most of which are petroleum derived knowing how to maintain the stable production of carbon compounds is critical and directly linked to modern life ishitani identifies the challenges for humanity as three major issues energy global warming and carbon based materials aiming to kill three birds with one stone research into the conversion of carbon dioxide into practical energy containing substances such as oil using light energy is underway this would allow use of solar light energy to obtain ideal carbon cycles which generate energy and carbon resources while helping to reduce co emissions however the benefits remain merely theoretical in the absence of efficient photocatalysts to date the prevailing view has been that highly efficient chemical reduction of co into useful substances is not practical or feasible actually until the late s the only efficient co reduction method involved electrolysis using currents generated from solar batteries the fact that spontaneous co reduction occurred when light was applied to photocatalysts was already known however efficiency was extremely low as suitable photocatalysts had not yet been tested towards an efficient co reduction mechanism however fate conspired to boost ishitani s co reduction photocatalyst research when he was still an undergraduate it was the emergence and publication of an astonishing research result in the mid s professor jean marie lehn a french supramolecular chemistry researcher and nobel laureate in chemistry discovered the ability of a rhenium complex to convert light to chemical energy despite its low durability and the fact that nobody had ever used such a rare metal complex as a photocatalyst its conversion efficiency proved excellent featuring a percent quantum yield simply put when photons are absorbed into the photocatalyst carbon dioxide molecules change to form carbon monoxide this was extraordinary and i remember feeling goose bumps when reading the paper figure rhenium ruthenium photocatalyst ishitani enhanced photocatalyst efficiency by bonding together ruthenium and rhenium complexes given that the former absorbs visible light more efficiently than the latter the encounter eventually prompted ishitani to start researching photocatalysts based on rhenium complexes in the s the initial percent quantum yield obtained in professor lehn s experiment has been constantly improved by ishitani reaching percent in he has been and remains among the best in the world in this field nevertheless practical utilization of his research is still unlikely anytime soon he admits however much lab test results may improve rhenium remains a rare metal and is not sufficiently prevalent on earth for its use to be commercialized i was happy with the positive evaluation of my research of course but i couldn t afford to dwell on that instead i had to decipher the mystery of how rhenium complexes could selectively reduce carbon dioxide clarifying the nature and behavior of the factors behind rhenium complex co reduction would facilitate the practical application of ishitani s research in the future his insatiable quest has now shifted away from rare metals to the use of other more readily available ones accordingly a new crest project based on japan science and technology agency jst strategic basic research program initiatives was launched in academic year the project led by assistant professor hiroyuki takeda at the ishitani maeda laboratory focuses on the application of manganese and iron complexes as photocatalysts this may mark a major step toward commercializing highly efficient co reduction as manganese and iron are far more abundant and affordable tokyo tech s environment activates global leaders ishitani concludes with encouragement for younger generations define your goals and dreams and act on them this will enable you to enjoy the laboratory activities you take on in your fourth year everyone should find something they want to do therefore you should visit specialists and listen to them attentively in order to pinpoint what that something is be ambitious when choosing your lifetime career finally he expresses his pride and high expectations for the culture of tokyo tech all tokyo tech faculty members consider their research to be best in the world naturally i have faith in my team as the world s leaders in photochemical co reduction consider this you too can be number one when you exceed my research tokyo tech

yukio kawano harnessing the potential of terahertz waves issue associate professor yukio kawano quantum nanoelectronics research center qnerc department of physical electronics graduate school of science and engineering exploring the last frontier of the electromagnetic spectrum while often thought of as very different light and radio waves are both electromagnetic waves what distinguishes the two is frequency this is how associate professor yukio kawano begins his introduction to terahertz waves the terahertz is a unit of frequency for electromagnetic waves electromagnetic waves formed by the vibrations of electric and magnetic fields propagate through space and substance these include gamma and x rays with a wavelength shorter than light and micro and radio waves with a longer wavelength terahertz frequencies cover a range of about thz between light and radio waves although the potential of terahertz technology has been suggested by research it has long been considered a difficult area and not much work has been done in the field as applications are now appearing however it is again attracting more interest figure terahertz frequency range terahertz waves exhibit great variability they are permeable like radio waves and travel in straight lines like lasers since terahertz waves penetrate materials such as paper wood and plastic images according to the rate of permeability of substances can be obtained using the shapes of these images non contact identification of substances is possible due to their rectilinear propagation terahertz waves can also be reflected by a mirror and focused by a lens in addition when terahertz waves are irradiated to substances they resonate with crystalline semiconductor lattice and biopolymer vibrations and absorb electromagnetic energy in chemical substances in consequence substance specific spectra occur different chemical substances display different spectral characteristics making it possible to identify impurities in pharmaceutical products in a non destructive way other potential applications include the inspection of semiconductors and ic cards for quality control preventing food contamination monitoring water levels in flora testing for toxic materials inspecting historical items such as paintings or paper money to facilitate restoration or detect forgery and pathology testing to detect cancer cells terahertz development and application however has always been inhibited by two major obstacles one is low image resolution images are created by exposing objects to light and radio waves shorter wavelengths produce greater detail which increases resolution longer wavelengths however deliver low resolution terahertz wavelengths are longer than light making images coarser the other obstacle has been the lack of detectors compatible with terahertz radiation terahertz photon energy is too low to measure as light and too high to measure as radio waves which means extremely low detection sensitivity measuring terahertz requires maximization of output involving an extremely large system it is these two obstacles kawano set out to overcome nano carbon miniaturizes detection and spectrometer devices figure terahertz detection setup kawano tried to increase image resolution to facilitate measurement he installed a mechanism that generates a small amount of near field light by irradiating terahertz radiation into holes that are smaller than wavelengths and added a detector function into an all in one semiconductor chip this increased resolution from micrometers to nanometers of a wavelength making it possible to measure fields smaller than wavelengths next kawano developed a compact spectroscopic device capable of monitoring a broader frequency band he used graphene a material for which andre geim and konstantin novoselov received the nobel prize in physics in graphene allowed kawano to increase the detection frequency from to thz making broadband measurement possible in kawano worked with rice university and sandia national laboratories in the us to jointly develop a terahertz detector employing a carbon nanotube array graphene is a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms theoretically the electron mass is zero the electron speed is that of light which is exponentially faster than other materials a carbon nanotube is one dimensional linear material that detects oscillations in the terahertz radiation field while ignoring vibrations perpendicular to the nanotube terahertz detectors also need to be cool for increased sensitivity to solve this issue kawano utilized a carbon nanotube array in the detector this innovation made use at room temperature possible and has been very highly regarded curiosity led to exploration of a different area semiconductors kawano took his undergraduate and graduate degrees at the university of tokyo he continued his study of semiconductor physics most notably the quantum hall effect after becoming an assistant professor at his alma mater he was interested in terahertz waves but wanted to know about semiconductors as he felt that high resolution terahertz measurement could possibly contribute to the visual control of semiconductor structure at the time however his focus was still on the basics of semiconductors he moved to riken and started working on terahertz waves riken was excellent because there were no walls between research fields says kawano riken provides a free environment for researchers to engage in interdisciplinary studies all researchers are encouraged to contact and seek knowledge from scientists in different fields with his desire to explore the potential of semiconductor physics kawano realized that terahertz waves might be a tool for research with this realization he began focusing on terahertz development and application he moved to tokyo tech in and broadened his studies to include terahertz application to biotechnology and other industries through joint research with private companies he has also continued his work on single molecule measurement and other fundamental studies research on the future application of terahertz waves in observing and controlling the quantum state in solid matter and the characteristics of electron waves is progressing the presence of terahertz radiation in electron wave interference destroys the characteristics of an interference pattern if we can restore it to its original state we can control it kawano s studies have already achieved results that have brought him one step closer to this goal there are a number of problems to be solved before commercialization the cost of producing measurement devices for example is a factor if costs remain high the technology will not be practical reducing the cost of the femtosecond laser remains a challenge it requires the development of a high sensitivity low noise semiconductor detector which utilizes mass produced semiconductor chips it is also necessary to improve the power of the oscillator and increase the sensitivity of the detector many researchers around the world are working on the development of oscillators at tokyo tech professor masahiro asada has taken the initiative in oscillator research and development link between science and engineering since childhood kawano has been an avid reader with a wide range of interests including classical literature he even thought about pursuing the humanities he tends to consider things without separating them into categories as he shifted from the field of science to engineering at riken he was merely following his interests this led him to results kawano looked back on what brought him to where he is now my experience has shown me that science and engineering are linked therefore i believe that collaboration across academic fields to deepen one s own fields of research and discover new areas contributes to the future development of science i hope that all tokyo tech students will first concentrate on expanding the fundamental elements of their individual research if they do this their potential is unlimited explanations of technical terms micrometer one micrometer is meters millionth of a meter or millimeters nanometer one nanometer is meters billionth of a meter or millimeters quantum hall effect the quantum hall effect is a phenomenon in which the longitudinal resistance of a two dimensional electron system created by confining electrons in a plane such as at the different joint interfaces of semiconductors becomes zero at low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields under which hall resistance is quantized nobel prizes in physics were awarded in and for the results of research on the quantum hall effect femtosecond femtosecond is

hidetoshi nishimori applying quantum annealing to computers issue professor hidetoshi nishimori department of physics graduate school of science and engineering an innovative theory for designing computers capable of possibly performing a tremendous amount of computation quantum mechanics is an incredibly difficult concept to understand professor hidetoshi nishimori says when explaining the mechanism of quantum computers which have been attracting attention for their potential to greatly surpass the speed of existing computers this is perhaps best summed up by a quote attributed to richard feynman one of the founders of quantum electrodynamics and winner of the nobel prize in physics if you think you understand quantum mechanics you don t understand quantum mechanics nishimori points out in the visible world water in rivers and oceans is a substance affected by environmental factors such as current and wind which generate states such as waves in the quantum world of sub atomic particles on the other hand substance cannot be distinguished from state matter exhibits both characteristics of particles and waves i e substance and state furthermore the laws of newtonian physics do not apply quantum mechanics the mysterious physics based on these characteristics is now applied to the design of quantum computers computers can be thought of as an aggregate of switches with only two states or or on or off individual switches are counted in units of bits while bits on current digital computers can only be or a single qubit on quantum computers can be both and at the same time now what can we do with this digital computers require n calculations to encode data into binary digits bits which means that the greater n is the more time is required for calculations quantum computers however perform multiple calculations in superposition states instead of performing individual calculations this allows them to quickly process extremely large amounts of numbers simultaneously giving them a decisive advantage over conventional computers quantum mechanics nishimori continues has been applied to current computers in for example semiconductor products such as memory and cpu the problem is that its application is limited to hardware but now quantum computers incorporate quantum mechanics into software and algorithms optimization greatly improves efficiency there are two models of quantum computers one is called the circuit model although extensive research has been conducted on this model we still have a long way to go before a practical device for real life use can be realized because the model is susceptible to noise and tens of millions of qubits and precise control are required for its commercialization the other is the quantum annealing model proposed by nishimori and his student tadashi kadowaki in quantum annealing is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems and is different from the traditional approach in that it does not involve algorithms or programs in the usual sense quantum annealing has been widely recognized as a model that has enabled the realization of quantum computers with commercial value an example traveling salesman problem to better understand combinatorial optimization problems let s take a look at the traveling salesman problem tsp tsp seeks the shortest possible route that a salesman can take to visit each city on a given map exactly once before returning to the origin applying quantum annealing to tsp we can express tsp in a quantum mechanical formula to find a solution using parallel computations the quantum annealing model is resilient to noise and its broad real life applications include the scheduling of transportation and enhanced efficiency in image recognition for medical diagnosis in addition it requires thousands rather than tens of millions of qubits which makes wide commercial dissemination in the near future a real possibility combinatorial optimization is remarkable in that it is also useful in machine learning a discipline that focuses on the development of computers with the ability to learn through example inputs and respond accurately to language and images finding similarities between neural networks in the human brain and spin glass problems although nishimori leads the research in quantum computing he was not very interested in physics as a high school student because he thought it puts emphasis on memorization of given formulas rather than logical reasoning he couldn t enjoy it like his favorite subject mathematics however nishimori eventually majored in physics professor masuo suzuki who taught statistical mechanics talked so enthusiastically about his research topics during his lectures that i was thoroughly fascinated nishimori s attraction to statistical mechanics came both from the exciting topics it presented and from the enthusiasm exuded by professor suzuki he was exposed to spin glass problems a hot topic of discussion at the time this eventually brought him to the formulation of quantum annealing theory in the s when he noticed similarities between spin glass theory and the theory of neural networks introduced by american physicist john hopfield in he saw an opportunity to introduce quantum effects into the formula and a door to an innovative field opened there are rare moments when everything you have learned suddenly comes together in your mind when i looked at what roles quantum effects play in neural networks i saw clear similarities to thermal non classical effects there were many researchers working on annealing but no one had looked at it in combination with quantum mechanics nishimori did and that eventually led to his success can quantum annealing machines solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently in the future courtesy of d wave systems inc there has recently been significant progress in research and development in the field of quantum computers in google and nasa purchased the d wave two the world s first commercialized quantum computer from d wave systems inc in canada in september google announced it would start development of related hardware it is globally recognized that the fundamental idea behind these quantum computers was based on the theory established by nishimori and kadowaki improvements in the efficiency of the methods to solve combinatorial optimization problems have big impacts on society the d wave two computer system uses qubits in theory it contains states simultaneously if development proceeds as planned in a few years quantum annealing machines will be able to solve some combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be solved by existing supercomputers nishimori concludes with a message to tokyo tech students it is of course important to solve problems with known methods but it is sometimes important to try very different unconventional approaches always keep your eyes open and try to find different perspectives this will lead you to a breakthrough explanations of technical terms richard phillips feynman richard phillips feynman was an american theoretical physicist in for his

c line mougenot affective engineering for product design issue associate professor c line mougenot department of mechanical engineering graduate school of engineeringy a field that studies user experience what is your main area of research the name of the field is engineering design my background is actually in product design and mechanical engineering mechanical engineering is about designing machines and systems while engineering design focuses on people s experience with machines and systems in engineering design we care about not only technology itself but also how people interface with technology what is unique about your lab my lab is part of the mechanical engineering department but we conduct research on how people use technology we focus on people as much as we do technology and care about how people use products that have been designed by engineers when engineers design products they mostly care about functionality but in our lab we are especially interested in people s experience including emotional experience with using products there are two important sides to product design one is functionality which is about engineering and the other is emotion which is about how people interact with products my lab is unique in that we care about the feelings that people experience when using technologies is that what affective engineering is about exactly affective engineering originated in japan and has spread all over the world affective engineering is about how to measure emotional reactions and how to apply these measurements in the design process it s about understanding what people feel when they interact with products and using this data to improve design how did you become interested in affective engineering i was trained as a mechanical engineer and i worked for a computer aided design software company for four years after getting my first master s degree when i was working for this company i noticed that most engineers focused on designing nice technologies but didn t care as much about how people would use them maybe it s the human part in me that felt that something was missing today products such as smartphones are very successful because people enjoy using them so what s important is not just the technologies inside products but also the enjoyment that products offer innovating the future of design do you have a vision of how your field will develop in the future in my lab we are trying to merge two innovative research fields affective engineering and interaction design interaction design is about how people use their brains bodies and senses to interact with products for example when using smartphones people use swiping gestures which makes the use of their phones intuitive and enjoyable we re interested in designing interesting interactions for users and bringing more sensory qualities to products we have several projects in the lab for designing new communication devices and are trying to imagine futuristic ways of communicating for example we have a team of students that is designing a device that expresses people s moods the device has an input and an output component if you touch the input component softly the output component will move gently if you grab the input component aggressively the output component will vibrate accordingly today we tend to dematerialize many things for example hand written letters have been replaced by emails this limits the use of our bodies and senses with typed text all messages look and feel the same i believe that affective engineering and interaction design will contribute to the development of devices that involve our bodies and senses to a greater extent and thus will lead to greater enjoyment for product users how does the scientific study of design benefit society the scientific study of design will lead to new methods for design such as methods used in testing users and collecting data in order to improve design these studies will lead to better products in terms of usability and pleasure the first scholar who studied design scientifically was herbert simon in the united states in he published a book called the sciences of the artificial design is part of everything around us that is artificial furniture computers and even the building that we re in anything that is designed can be improved by the scientific study of design design is multidisciplinary design is not simply a matter of aesthetics mougenot explains that design is a combination of various disciplines for example engineering is necessary for creating new products but human sciences is also necessary for understanding how people perceive products affective engineering captures the multifaceted nature of design and offers an approach to creating designs that are both functional and emotionally appealing looking at tokyo from the point of view of design what brought you to japan my first visit to japan was back in when i spent my summer vacation working as a research intern my professor who had studied in japan for a few years recommended me to go overseas to expand my horizons and that was the only reason i came to japan i did not have any special attachment to japan at that time however my second visit was a bit different this was when i applied to the university of tokyo as a postdoctoral fellow this time i realized that japan has an appealing culture tokyo is a really big city with many interesting cultural activities and at the same time it s safe quiet and clean i ride my bicycle a lot in tokyo whereas in paris it is much more difficult to get around by bicycle i enjoy the quality of life in tokyo from the point of view of design the ways in which cities can be used is just as important as their appearance tokyo may be better designed than paris in terms of how people are able to access and use what the city offers such as the transportation system also in japan there are many products with amusing design such as toilets fitted with pressurized water sprayers and warm seats these products are useful and pleasant to use a perfect design if you ask me what are the advantages of pursuing your research at tokyo tech i think i joined tokyo tech at a very good time because there are many things in education and research that are related to design for example in our department we are creating a design space with several faculty members where people can gather for design projects and conduct design activities such as brainstorming prototyping and user testing also tokyo tech attracts students from many different countries so there is diversity here diversity helps foster creativity as i can observe in my lab where students come from six different countries this is a very exciting time to be at tokyo tech both for faculty and students what message would you like to give to tokyo tech students i would encourage everyone to go abroad and interact with international students traveling and meeting new people will enhance your creativity which will make you a better engineer c line mougenot profile the special topics component of the tokyo tech website shines a spotlight on recent developments in

kotaro tadano precise control with surgical assist robots issue associate professor kotaro tadano advanced mechanical systems division precision and intelligence laboratory surgical assist robots lessen the burden on doctors and patients move your head the endoscopic image moves with it following associate professor tadano s instructions i put the head mounted display on and turned my head from side to side and then up and down the endoscopic image on the display in front of me moved along with it moreover the image responded to even the smallest movements of my head the image was as clear as if i were looking at the area with my own eyes the robot arm is synchronized with an angular velocity sensor that detects head movement and moves the endoscope this was developed as part of the minimally invasive surgical assist robot system based on ultraprecise control technology for gases a project tadano and his group have been working on under the program for creating startups from advanced research and technology start program of the ministry of education culture sports science and technology recent years have seen a growth in the popularity of laparoscopic surgery in which an endoscope and small diameter instruments are inserted through small ports to reduce patient burden some hospitals are now also introducing surgical assist robots the da vinci surgical system one of the first such robots in the field is a typical example tadano s surgical assist robot uses pneumatic actuators instead of the electric motors employed in the da vinci system it features pneumatic actuators for a manipulator connected to the forceps and an endoscope control system that remotely controls them this allows precise positioning and a softer touch that reduces the risk of damage to organs during surgical procedures in addition to these advantages the reduced weight of the system makes set up easier the most important feature is feedback of the contact force to the operator through a pneumatic cylinder connected to the forceps this enables delicate and precise control of the contact force for enhanced performance in more complicated surgical operations the robot is expected to rival the more expensive da vinci surgical system the advantage of a motor driven device is that it can easily achieve a certain level of positioning accuracy through gear controlled speed reduction but the contact force tends to be greater on the other hand a pneumatic device can control contact force because it can soften motion by detecting external force since the robot is designed for surgery the capability to absorb contact force is the greatest advantage of a pneumatic system in the project tadano s group has started to work on separate commercialization of the endoscope control system in november they registered the system as a general medical device class i and have conducted tests at clinical sites in collaboration with the university hospital preparation for the start of domestic sales in has been advancing step by step with future plans to enter overseas markets commercialization of the forceps manipulator is expected in three to four years for this tadano established a company named riverfield inc in may with his former academic supervisor kenji kawashima who still teaches at the institute as a visiting professor and is also a professor at the institute of biomaterials and bioengineering of tokyo medical and dental university kawashima serves as president of riverfield the company name combines river the english translation of the first part of kawashima s name and field the english translation of the last part of tadano s name inspired by advanced technologies in the u s to enter the world of medical robotics interested in the world of space engineering tadano entered tokyo tech after graduating from high school in hokkaido he changed his area of concentration from physics to mechanical engineering department of mechano micro engineering interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering for the master s degree program and was thinking of focusing on remote controlled robotics for construction machinery at that time the da vinci surgical system had just come into the spotlight and the new trend of collaboration between medicine and engineering was starting to attract attention kawashima asked tadano if he would be interested in working on surgical assist robot systems together tadano sensed that this was a new frontier and immediately accepted his offer just at that time in fact professor kawashima had been engaged in the development of remote controlled robots for construction machinery but was searching for new areas to pursue although the da vinci surgical system had already been in practical use i think he saw something because research on surgical assist robotics has a lot in common with his work on remote control systems it was against this background that he put me in charge of the new research difference in the sense of time between medicine and engineering tadano took this opportunity to step into collaboration between medicine and engineering for the development of surgical assist robots and began interacting with tokyo medical and dental university tmdu a member of confederation of four universities tadano and his group began by visiting doctors on staff at tmdu s university hospital to gather information and ask for their comments on concept ideas in the early stage of research however he was often surprised at the difference in the way the two fields looked at things i was shocked at first by their completely different sense of time when i suggested a model to a doctor for example he said that s good can you get it to me next month when engineers produce something they base their design on measurements and figures doctors on the other hand tend to look at things through their feelings i struggled to figure out how to translate those feelings into numerical values through the experience i learned there are many challenges in bridging the gap between medicine and engineering development takes more however than technical assistance from doctors alone the development of medical robots requires cooperation from various fields including electrical engineering and optics five or six years ago a number of companies showed interest in the potential of the system to change the world of medicine but they hesitated to move forward to avoid risk so we found it difficult to further our research at that time if things continue this way we won t be able to put our research into practical use we need a new breakthrough just then the start project was launched tadano submitted an application for the project with kawashima and it was selected he tenaciously continued his research for more than a decade and looks back with pride we continue with our research everyday with the prospect of ultimately constructing a brand new surgical method from scratch i think our ultimate goal is to make surgical procedures less stressful to patients and say look how easy it is through medical robot development with a brand new concept engineering students can learn to see from the doctor s perspective while preparing for commercialization tadano has been training younger researchers students in his lab link their research topics for graduate theses to the needs of doctors in the university hospital which means that they must complete systems or robots between one year and months since engineering students rarely have an opportunity to work with doctors at the university hospital during their research and development the experience is very inspiring in addition i think the chance to see the different perspectives that engineers and doctors have through the development of prototypes in their school days has a significantly positive impact on each student s future above all it is a precious experience for students to learn the entire process of making robots from concept and design in the course of development with an eye toward commercialization the future of medical robotics is a future full of dreams finally tadano has a message for young researchers interest makes even the most difficult challenges enjoyable this is my experience find a field or topic that interests and challenges you deeply something that pulls you toward it and have confidence in your ability to move forward as you learn and absorb do this and opportunities will surely come explanations of technical terms da vinci surgical system

hideki taguchi chaperones supporting protein life cycles issue professor hideki taguchi department of biomolecular engineering graduate school of bioscience and biotechnology proteins that assist other proteins chaperones as you know once an egg is boiled and hardened by thermal denaturation it will never be restored to its original condition however there is a protein in our bodies that makes something similar possible says taguchi with a twinkle in his eyes of course a boiled egg can never return to a raw egg however extraordinary events do occur within life forms this is true for not only eukaryotes such as humans which have cell nuclei but also procaryotes such as bacteria which have no cell nuclei according to taguchi chaperones are necessary for proteins to take shape and work in our bodies it seems that these chaperones have an influence on protein denaturation what exactly are chaperones proteins make up most of the human body muscles skin hair nails and even digestive enzymes could not exist without proteins proteins are string shaped polymers that consist of linearly connected amino acids these string shaped proteins form a spatial conformation by being folded in order to perform their functions origami is a close analogy origami requires processes such as folding blowing up with air and so on to form a perfect shape to put it simply proteins are born with the capacity to perform these processes on their own these processes are called folding discovered by christian anfinsen in the s however anfinsen s results were demonstrated only in test tubes and it was discovered later that folding doesn t occur so easily in cells this is because amino acids which are supposed to be hidden within proteins are exposed in the process of folding the exposed amino acids aggregate between molecules if left alone and this inhibits folding taguchi and his colleagues have been studying a group of proteins called chaperones that prevent the aggregation of proteins and assist folding let s look at the life cycle of a protein from its synthesis to degradation suppose that the stage in which the protein is synthesized based on the genetic information of dna is its birth then it matures by folding moves to different places suffers stress under pressure ages into a filamentous protein called amyloid and eventually faces death we now know that chaperones support proteins in every stage of their life cycle they are indispensable for proteins to take shape and properly perform their functions shifting from chemistry to life sciences driven by fascination with protein though taguchi is now a leading researcher on chaperones he wasn t always interested in bioscience after entering tokyo tech he initially studied applied chemistry which had nothing to do with bioscience he devoted himself to the research of organic synthesis in the department of chemical engineering however his interest greatly shifted to bioscience with the discovery of the helix structure of dna one of the greatest discoveries of the th century as he got absorbed in reading the book the double helix written by james d watson one of the discoverers of the dna helix he became more and more drawn into the drama that unfolded behind the scenes of the great discovery having made up his mind taguchi changed his major and decided to pursue a master s degree in bioscience he moved from ookayama to suzukakedai campus and entered the laboratory of tairo oshima the dean of the graduate school at that time who significantly contributed to the establishment of the graduate school of biosciences and biotechnology he joined the laboratory with excitement however he was completely in the dark about where to start his research that s when masasuke yoshida an assistant professor at that time approached him and asked him if he would like to conduct research on an interesting protein that had just been discovered taguchi looks back and says with a laugh that he would have never thought that this interesting protein chaperone would later become his main research topic at the time i started my research the mechanisms of chaperones were not known at all perhaps that was lucky for me the subject was just starting to attract attention worldwide and i was able to work at the frontier of a cutting edge field various research initiatives centered on protein there is a wide variety of chaperones the type that taguchi initially studied was chaperonin chaperonin is one of the most typical chaperones that supports the folding of proteins which is essential to every cell research on chaperonin has been advanced globally and it is said that a type of chaperonin called groel found in escherichia coli assists the folding of hundreds of proteins in cells details regarding the mechanism of action of chaperonins have been discovered but there are still many things such as their functions within cells that remain unknown taguchi has also been investigating the mechanism of protein based infectious agents called prions which alter the conformation of proteins by using a model based on yeast prions even though life sciences has considerably advanced we still cannot create proteins with catalytic functions something that life forms can do very easily in a sense something very mysterious is happening i really enjoy myself every day because i get to conduct research on chaperones which support these mysterious functions of proteins integrating different fields to develop a new field taguchi currently leads research efforts as the representative of a new research area called nascent chain biology which was selected for kakenhi grant in aid for scientific research on innovative areas in fiscal year although information about proteins is contained in dna proteins cannot be directly synthesized from dna information within dna is first transcribed to messenger rna mrna then translated with the help of ribosome and transfer rna trna and finally synthesized into nascent polypeptide chains or nascent chains proteins made of many chained amino acids taguchi and his colleagues are responsible for advancing research on nascent chains it is impossible to solve the mysteries of life forms without thinking outside the box in order to uncover the mechanism of proteins a new research approach was necessary the central dogma of biology considers nascent chains as mere intermediates that exist on the interface or boundary between rna and protein however recent research has revealed life phenomena such as ingenious self control of folding and quality control performed by nascent chains and it was discovered that some unique biological functions are performed only in the state of nascent chains considering this fact in order to understand all aspects of cell regulatory functions centering on nascent chains it is essential for the research of rna and proteins to be integrated in other words it is time to break out of the old paradigm strive to surpass your mentor years have passed since taguchi shifted his research area from applied chemistry to bioscience he has been at the forefront of chaperone research since then reflecting on his experience taguchi gave an inspiring message to young researchers above all you should completely devote yourself to your field or research topic once you enter a laboratory read research papers and perform experiments as much as possible you should dedicate yourself to doing these things at least once even if your efforts do not directly lead you to a career the experience will benefit you in your future endeavors further taguchi strongly emphasized that if students dedicate themselves to their research they can become more knowledgeable about their area of study than their instructors strive to surpass your mentor it doesn t have to be in all areas just focus on one and you ll be able to do it keep this in mind when pursuing your research and do so with enthusiasm

hideo hosono manipulating electrons well to elicit the potential of materials part special report part professor hideo hosono frontier research center director materials research center for element strategy professor hideo hosono is a leading candidate for the nobel prize for his research on iron based superconductors he has been focusing on transparent oxide materials in his research and made significant achievements one such material c a cao al o a constituent of alumina cement is at the heart of all of his research professor hosono spoke about the allure of transparent materials and their potential as well as about his research achievements faces tokyo tech researchers special report hideo hosono part electric current passed through a transparent amorphous oxide material i heard that you were doing research on transparent oxides before you began research on superconductivity i am still researching them the clear crystal glasses used for drinking whiskey are sparkly and beautiful wouldn t you say i love transparent materials i ve been researching them ever since i was in graduate school trying to somehow relate them to electrons in i moved to tokyo tech as an associate professor that was when my research partner at the time professor hiroshi kawazoe currently professor emeritus had just begun research on new transparent conductive oxides until then i had been working on photonic glass at the nagoya institute of technology but when i came to tokyo tech i was able to continue research on transparent materials you then discovered a transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor which led to the creation of the igzo semiconductor is that correct i began research on transparent amorphous oxides around the time that masahiro yasukawa now a professor in the department of materials science and engineering at kochi national college of technology obtained his experimental results while searching for a new transparent oxide semiconductor made of crystal he discovered that an amorphous thin film of silver antimonite agsbo which he had obtained by chance had electron mobility that was comparable to that of crystal amorphous materials are non crystalline that is the atoms are not regularly aligned in technical terms they are materials that display no sharp peaks in x ray diffraction at the time it was commonly believed that unless a material has atoms that are nicely aligned like crystal silicon si electrons could not move smoothly for electricity to flow research on amorphous silicon was being actively conducted but it was understood that compared to crystalline silicon it was much harder for electrons to move therefore no one thought that amorphous oxides which are insulators in most cases could make superior semiconductors it was reasonable for people to dismiss the potential of amorphous oxide semiconductors and assume that they would be far inferior to crystalline semiconductors even if such materials could be created but i had a good feeling that this was going to be it i started thinking about how amorphous oxides could have high electron mobility and immediately came up with a model this was a model for a materials system that allowed electrons within amorphous oxides to be as mobile as they are in crystal a system which later led to the creation of the igzo semiconductor to explain it simply until then it was believed that in order for electrons to move smoothly atoms had to be nicely lined up as they are in crystal but i noted that it would be sufficient to have well linked metal ion orbitals the spaces where electrons can enter and move it s easy to understand if you think of the orbitals of atoms as metal balls imagine a string of metal balls when the balls are lined up straight they represent a crystal when they are in a state of disarray they are amorphous however as with the metal balls the orbitals of electrons are spatially spread out and spherical in shape and if one makes contact with its neighbor the electrons even when in disarray are still able to move smoothly the orbitals of atoms can take various shapes and these shapes and the spacing of the orbitals are important see column column why certain materials are able to conduct electricity well even if they are amorphous non crystalline figure the paths traversed by electrons in covalent and ionic semiconductors with ionic oxide semiconductors the spherical s orbitals of the p block metals overlap nicely in both the crystal and amorphous states with covalent semiconductors the orbitals overlap perfectly in the crystal state but they are hardly able to keep such well overlapping positions in the amorphous state due to the high anisotropy of orbitals and structural randomness atoms each have a set number of electrons that exist in small regions called orbitals orbitals have various shapes and spacing which are determined by the type of atom when two atoms join together or couple their orbitals overlap closely electrons move where orbitals overlap so electricity flows for example in the case of silicon which is often used as a semiconductor the orbitals overlap in the crystalline state as shown in the top left image of figure silicon orbitals have an orientation so when silicon is in the amorphous non crystalline state the overlapping regions become small as a result electricity is not able to flow as nearly as well as they can in the crystalline state on the other hand consider ionic materials where coupling occurs in spherical orbitals that are spatially spread out such as the s orbital of p block cation see images on the right in figure in this case the materials may become amorphous with irregular alignment of atoms but that would have little effect on the path of the electrons the overlapping orbitals as long as the spherical orbitals are spread out widely as a result electricity is able to flow seamlessly even in the amorphous state professor hosono noticed this and identified the combinations of atoms that have such orbitals in his paper figure types and shapes of electron orbitals of atoms electrons in atoms each move along specific orbitals i understand that this material has already been put to practical use you must be referring to igzo it s an oxide semiconductor composed of indium gallium zinc and oxygen it has begun to be used in tablet pcs smart phones and recently large organic el televisions in when we published a paper on amorphous oxides we specifically mentioned which metal oxides can have high mobility even when they are amorphous among them were of course indium gallium and zinc igzo allows a high density ceramic material to be easily prepared and by using a common method called sputtering thin films can be made from this material on a large sized glass plate i think that this is one of the primary reasons why igzo was put into practical use very quickly among a variety of candidate materials i proposed the world s reaction must have been amazing when your paper was published there was almost no reaction laughter i presented the paper at the international conference on amorphous semiconductors held in august in kobe that was when amorphous silicon was at its zenith so there were around papers presented but mine was the only one on amorphous oxides the reaction to it was all but non existent however when our article appeared in nature in we got a great reaction in the article we used igzo as an example to show that thin film transistors tfts made of transparent amorphous oxide have ten times the mobility than those made of amorphous silicon there was a demand for semiconductors that could be easily made into tfts with greater mobility ten years after the conference in i gave a presentation on amorphous oxide semiconductors at a plenary session of the same conference held in lisbon the general chair was a researcher from europe who remembered my presentation in i prefaced my presentation by saying this is a kind of revenge for the lack of reaction to my talk at the conference in it was an emotional moment for me what do you think the future holds for amorphous oxides around the year flexible transistors and devices fabricated on plastic substrates characterized as flexible electronics started being researched extensively they are based on organic semiconductors but i believed amorphous oxides would be much superior for flexible electronics applications in particular they have much greater mobility than organic semiconductors they are also much more chemically stable at present high definition technology used in it devices are rapidly advancing and materials with high electron mobility will become critical to accommodate this needless to say transparent semiconductors are particularly suitable for application in conventional displays i actually would like to see transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors used to make large organic el displays organic el displays are said to be the next generation display technology that will replace lcds but they still face certain technical obstacles in addition to the unevenness and instability of the pixels they cannot compete with lcds in terms of how large they can get i think these problems could potentially be solved by using new materials namely transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors promotion of university developed technology i wish japanese companies would be more aggressive in putting the results of basic research conducted at japanese universities and research centers to practical use if they could mention that they re using university developed technology that would go a long way toward increasing the motivation of young researchers and students the c a electride catalyst would change the year old ammonia synthesis process is it true that there is a go to material in your materials research c a cao al o figure there is a material that has been a staple of my research for about years see figure it is a material called c a cao al o which is a constituent of alumina cement and it s of course transparent in powder form it s white it s endlessly fascinating it s kind of like a toy chest for me for example c a was initially an insulator but i tried to change its electrical properties by replacing oxygen ions accommodating its crystal structure with electrons when i did that it first became a transparent semiconductor then it became a metal when the temperature is lowered electrical resistance is decreased and in it also became a superconductor the wonders hidden in undergraduate laboratory experiments when i was a newly minted assistant professor at the nagoya institute of technology i oversaw undergraduate student experiments a colleague of mine in a neighboring division was overseeing an experiment involving the synthesis of c a when i went there to shoot the breeze i noticed something interesting c a is made by mixing melting and then solidifying calcium carbonate and alumina from its molten state at a high temperature it is cooled and solidified at this temperature it was supposed to become colorless but i noticed that it became deep yellow then it was rapidly cooled until it turned into transparent glass but when it was heated again an enormous number of bubbles containing oxygen gas were generated in the entire sample i wanted to know why these seemingly strange phenomena occurred in such a commonplace material and wound up taking up this subject as my own research topic you may be surprised that there are new discoveries hidden in student experiments but i think there are many elementary things that we actually don t understand since then i have tried various things on this cement material nowadays it s become somewhat famous as a multifunctional material and i think i deserve some credit for that laughter this material has now become a catalyst for ammonia synthesis right it s well known that ammonia nh is an important component of fertilizers in recent years however its value has risen as a storage material for hydrogen h which is used in fuel cells hydrogen is a gas so its volume is large which makes it difficult to store and transport but if it can be stored in the form of liquid ammonia and then separated out when necessary the problem can be solved since about years ago ammonia synthesis has been carried out using the haber bosch process there have been researchers who took on the challenge of developing a new method of ammonia synthesis but nobody has succeeded in replacing the haber bosch process the subject of ammonia synthesis is thus said to be cursed why is the haber bosch process so difficult to replace the reason is that in order to synthesize ammonia it is first necessary to break the strong triple bonds of nitrogen molecules n n and convert them into two nitrogen atoms to do that i theorized that a material that has two contradictory properties would be effective namely a material that transfers electrons easily like an alkali metal but doesn t react with nitrogen the c a electride is a material that has both of these properties so with its surface supported by minute particles of ruthenium to capture n an idea first proposed by the late professor emeritus atsumu ozaki and professor emeritus ken ichi aika of tokyo tech we tested it as a catalyst as a result the ammonia synthesis reaction proceeded smoothly see column column the manufacture of ammonia is still conducted by the haber bosch process which was adapted for industrial use a hundred years ago since then small improvements have been made to the process however if the elevated pressure and temperature requirements of atmospheres and are not satisfied the synthesis reaction will not proceed efficiently this process thus requires a large amount of energy professor hosono is aiming to develop a catalyst that will enable ammonia synthesis under rather different conditions the material that is the basis of the catalyst c a electride cao al o doped with a high concentration of electrons is a cement material made from lime and alumina it is composed of numerous cage like structures initially oxygen ions o are inside these structures however when heated together with titanium metal the oxygen ions join with the titanium and easily escape after which electrons e enter the electrons are easily transferred outside the cages so they can transfer to the nitrogen molecules n n and break the strong triple bonds as a result with this catalyst ammonia can be synthesized at atmosphere and professor hosono believes this temperature may be lowered further this material consists of cage like structures and various atoms and electrons can be contained within them in the case of electrons however they are loosely bound when they enter so they can easily get out the ammonia synthesis catalyst uses this property with this catalyst it should be possible to synthesize ammonia with times the efficiency of the traditional method it must have been difficult to develop an ammonia synthesis catalyst that competes with a year old method of course it wasn t easy and our research is only in the preliminary stages the haber bosch process is not such an easy process to replace after all it is considered a monumental achievement we want to create a process that can synthesize ammonia under simple conditions under ordinary pressure and at as low a temperature as possible and in a place where hydrogen can be obtained on site after about ten years and many failed attempts i was able to make this material into a catalyst with ammonia synthesis the key is the transfer of electrons so the surface where nitrogen and the catalyst meet is important therefore i needed to somehow observe the surface of the c a electride at the atomic level some people told me that this was probably impossible since the material has a complicated crystalline structure with no cleavage but yoshitake toda who at that time was a third year doctoral student currently a specially appointed lecturer really worked hard on it and in we were able to observe the surface structure of the material using a scanning tunneling microscope we were also greatly helped by professor hiroyuki hirayama an expert in surface science as a result i was able to understand why using c a electride as a catalyst hadn t gone well until then as it turned out the cages on the surface were broken and the electrons couldn t go into them since i discovered that the cages could be rebuilt by heating the electride to an appropriate temperature range i began to seriously test the material as an ammonia catalyst i wanted to get a catalyst expert to participate so when i was about to begin the first project i went and asked professor michikazu hara of the materials and structures laboratory if he could help us he responded by telling the story i mentioned earlier about how ammonia catalyst is cursed laughter however when i told him about a mechanism that i came up with for transferring electrons he immediately agreed to participate after all professor hara began his research on catalysts because he was fascinated by ammonia synthesis this is how the effort to develop a new ammonia catalyst moved ahead it s actually an ordinary material c a is a conventional constituent of alumina cement having researched it for many years i see it as a toy chest in which new things can still be found however in when i began the jst erato project and told a postdoctoral research fellow that i wanted to manifest electron functionality in a cement material he reacted with disbelief saying he had never heard of such a thing laughter dr katsuro hayashi who became a professor at kyushu university this april was in charge of this research at the time he must have been truly worried about whether any positive results could be obtained we ended up discovering unexpected functions such as superconductivity and potential for ammonia synthesis in materials that are by no means unusual this kind of thing happens in most of my work the papers that i submit with confidence sometimes get rejected because of unconventional ideas every time that happens i gather the necessary data and reassemble the logic to dispel any misunderstandings it definitely takes perseverance first has ended how will you proceed with the next stage of your research since i ve been conducting the ministry of education culture sports science and technology s element strategy project element strategy is an initiative for developing new materials to make a sustainable society possible i also began a new program for jst last october called the materials science and application of electrides which was selected as accel s first project i wanted to freely conduct my own research and not be bound any longer by government projects but that doesn t seem to be in the cards laughter however i think that all of the research i ve done until now is encompassed by the term element strategy and i look forward to continuing to work on superconductivity transparent oxide semiconductors and catalysts in the element strategy project we proposed new ways of thinking about materials research towards that end i ve selected young project members in their s and s and we re conducting research in close cooperation with the high energy accelerator research organization the national institute for materials science and the center of computational materials science of the institute for solid state physics at the university of tokyo i think we ve been able to put together a very interesting organization the time span for the project is ten years so we haven t taken up anything that will produce immediate results but i think interesting results will certainly be produced down the line unlike with this project my research group will be undertaking the accel project for the most part how have you been able to produce such diverse research results i don t think i ve produced any great results yet but i try to have a broad perspective when i work with materials i believe that it s important to precisely understand where a certain material fits in the big picture and whether you re dealing with a special case or a general case this is not something that should be done by intuition alone i ve studied a variety of subjects including organic chemistry inorganic chemistry solid state physics and materials so i think i have quite a bit of fundamental knowledge and i try to fully utilize it in carrying out my work finally i heard that you call yourself a materials scientist could you explain why basically my field is chemistry but the research of solid materials involves both chemistry and physics so i stopped feeling the need to separate them and ended up calling them science originally i didn t have any strong desire to work on materials when i was hired as an assistant professor at the nagoya institute of technology i worked under professor emeritus yoshihiro abe and there was an event that made me realize that the development of new materials can have a big impact on the world as a result i came to think that materials research is great and i chose to pursue this path also my attitude toward materials changed greatly when my daughter was born in the world of materials people call new materials next generation materials initially this term didn t have any particular meaning to me but when my daughter was born i understood its true meaning i knew then that materials research is research that is useful for the betterment of society and essential for life and i came to feel a sense of pride in being involved with materials i thus call myself a materials scientist confronting young researchers today s young researchers are excellent in general but the more talented they are the more impudent they can be i try my best to keep up with them and engage them in extensive discussions but that leaves me exhausted i m steadily losing energy as i get older laughter but i still refuse to retreat research is truly interesting i would get tired of playing slot machines in a day or two but i could never get tired of research laughter a word from the interviewer we ve learned that all of professor hosono s achievements are produced as a result of him first accurately understanding the properties of the materials and then working on them to elicit new functions his broad knowledge of the sciences gives him the unique ability to identify these hidden functions i am greatly looking forward to what he will discover next hideo hosono profile faces tokyo tech researchers special report hideo hosono part the special topics component of the tokyo tech

hideo hosono manipulating electrons well to elicit the potential of materials part special report part professor hideo hosono frontier research center director materials research center for element strategy for his discovery of iron based superconductors in professor hideo hosono was selected as a thomson reuters citation laureate in and became a leading contender for the nobel prize his passion for materials research knows no bounds even now he is continuing the search for new functional materials professor hosono doesn t just operate at the leading edge of research on iron based superconductors a transparent oxide semiconductor igzo which is attracting attention and is widely used to drive displays of smart phones and tablet pcs is also a result of professor hosono s research moreover in catalyst research he has been trying to change the ammonia synthesis process which has remained unaltered for approximately a hundred years how is it that professor hosono has been able to undertake research in such diverse fields and achieve major results in each of them in this and an upcoming second article we will present professor hosono s achievements and the research style that made them possible a magnet becomes a superconductor the first new high temperature superconductor discovered in years the research that is most representative of you and your work is the discovery of iron based superconductors correct this discovery is highly regarded and is the reason reuters named you a leading candidate for the nobel prize in my research group announced that we had discovered an iron based superconductor a high temperature superconductor that contains iron as its main constituent the reason this discovery had an impact is that it overturned the commonly held view that elements like iron with a large magnetic moment must be inimical to the manifestation of superconductivity see photograph below left consequently this discovery had an impact on the world of superconductivity a superconductor is floating above a permanent magnet this is called the meissner effect when a magnetic field is applied to a superconductor the magnetic flux will not penetrate the superconductor as long as the magnetic field does not exceed a certain strength this phenomenon is characteristic of superconductors see drawing below right it has thus been thought that materials containing iron which easily become magnetized could not become superconductors would you say that this impact rekindled superconductivity research worldwide that seems to be the case regarding superconductivity the discovery of a cuprate superconductor by georg bednorz and alex m ller in was truly an event when they doped the carriers holes in an oxide of copper which normally conducts almost no electricity it became a superconductor moreover the superconducting transition temperature the temperature at which a material becomes a superconductor was this was much higher than the superconducting transition temperatures of the other metal and alloy superconductors known at the time this high temperature superconductor was startling it turned the world upside down in superconductivity research even today many researchers are frantically searching for some material that will become superconductive at a higher temperature with such a material it would then be possible to create such things as maglev magnetic levitation trains and power transmission wires with almost no energy loss but superconductivity does not occur unless the temperature is extremely low which has so far prevented putting superconductors to practical use moreover in the s the rise in the superconducting transition temperature of cuprate superconductors hit a ceiling superconductivity researchers concluded that new efforts based on new materials were necessary that is where our iron based superconductor enters the picture as a result research seeking new materials with a high superconducting transition temperature once again heated up worldwide it was against this background that our first paper in in which we reported the discovery of an iron based superconductor had the highest number of citations in the world for that year and it continues to be cited today as of may it has been cited over times google scholar did this major achievement result from long years of superconductivity research no there were many people around me who began superconductivity research in response to the discovery of cuprate superconductors in however i did not get involved that was because i did not see how i could beat the competition what makes it possible to prevail in research i believe is achieving originality at a global level i won t undertake research if its originality is not clear from the start however in i found that as i had anticipated a cement material c a see the second article which i had researched for many years could become a superconductor contrary to my expectation the superconducting transition temperature was low but this research stimulated me to undertake superconductivity research interestingly though it was not in this belatedly begun superconductivity research that i discovered the iron based semiconductor actually besides superconductivity research i was also doing research on imparting magnetic properties to semiconductors in creating semiconductors endowed with new properties i was trying to discover possibilities for new uses of oxide semiconductors for example oxide semiconductors can be used both for semiconductor memory and magnetic memory and for operational circuits and magnetic memory it was in the course of this research that i was able to discover the iron based superconductor professor hosono transparent materials cultivated the eye of a researcher while many researchers were just beginning superconductivity research i felt i should continue research on transparent materials to be discussed in the second article which i greatly liked i researched them for many years obsessed with their transparency the reason i abandoned this obsession is that i began research aimed at imparting magnetism to semiconductors to impart magnetism to a material the material must contain a transition metal that has spin such as iron or cobalt but materials that contain such metals are not transparent transparent materials are similar not just in appearance but also have many properties and electron states in common by having researched such materials for many years i feel that i was able to cultivate an eye for looking at materials for imparting magnetism to a semiconductor i selected layered compounds containing a transition metal that has a large magnetic moment such as iron to serve as the target material among such compounds i investigated an oxypnictide compound laofeas whose main constituent is iron however i was unable to obtain the desired properties with this material of course it was not a superconductor so i decided to try to change its electrical properties by using a technique for replacing the oxygen ions in laofeas with fluorine ions see column doping carriers by substituting ions of a similar size but of a different valence is a common technique in semiconductor research and when i did that laofeas became a superconductor this was the discovery of an iron based superconductor column the iron based superconductor that professor hosono discovered ordinarily electricity flows through a metal for example iron but not through a metal oxide ferric oxide moreover it was commonly believed that metals like iron which have the ability to become magnets would not become superconductors however the iron based superconductor which professor hosono discovered in is a pnictide p or as containing iron why was a pnictide containing iron able to become a superconductor it was because professor hosono achieved both a structure in which the electrons could move electricity could flow even in the presence of oxygen and a chemical constituent that eliminates the magnetism of iron see drawing the true identity of the iron based superconductor is laofeas an oxypnictide compound whose main constituent is iron this compound has a structure with alternating layers of lao and feas with this structure however electrical resistance does not become zero the compound does not become a superconductor even if the temperature is lowered therefore professor hosono thought of changing the electrical properties by electron doping electron doping consists of injecting electrons into the interior of a material in the case of laofeas some of its oxygen ions o are replaced with fluorine ions f each time one oxygen ion is replaced with one fluorine ion the result is that the material becomes doped with electrons the electrons that are injected flow over the feas layer and enhance the conductivity of the feas layer and diminish the antiferromagnetism when the temperature becomes low they create a state of superconductivity with zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism thus an iron based superconductor is born it s said that you discovered the iron based superconductor by chance but can it not be said that you intentionally created it through the technique of ionic substitution it bears a strong resemblance to the discovery of a cuprate superconductor by bednorz and m ller to be exact they discovered superconductivity in hole doped cuprates and we discovered it in electron doped laofeas the results of superconductivity research are not limited to what you plan but it s important to build your predictions and to proceed based on theory if you proceed at random without forethought you won t discover any superconductors you have to think thoroughly and then attack with all your might but even then in the end you won t find that groundbreaking superconductor if you don t have luck this is the consensus view of experts in the field also from that experience i came to believe that besides your core research it s important to conduct research that covers the area around it if you hope to be able to discover superior new materials six years have passed since the discovery superconductor research has come quite a long way since then wouldn t you say the importance of iron based superconductors has been recognized i obtained the opportunity to conduct research on the exploration of new superconductors and related functional materials and application of superconducting wires for industry from to as part of a large government funded project first funding program for world leading innovative r d on science and technology i created a top team of japan s ace researchers for this project we sought to discover new superconductors and also conducted research on raising the superconducting transition temperature regarding the former objective we synthesized approximately candidate substances among which we discovered superconducting materials about chemical compounds this is a success rate of percent what do you think when you hear that number does it seem low actually in the world of superconductivity research professionals it s considered high first research colleagues don t fear loneliness original research is lonely work so i think being able to endure loneliness is a prerequisite for producing original results even in first i limited the opportunities for members to learn about what the others were doing in their respective research to one general meeting every six months i think i was able to maintain a good feeling of tension among the members of course at the general meetings they totally disclosed their research to each other and discussed strenuously to promote everyone s overall progress when you want to do something original you can t be afraid of loneliness because originality is truly something achieved alone at the same time we conducted research on raising the superconductor transition temperature of the iron based superconductor we had initially discovered instead of replacing lafeaso s oxygen ions with fluorine ions as we had been doing until then i thought of replacing them with negative hydrogen ions h this is an approach that i successfully applied to a cement compound c a cao al o in by doing this i expected to be able to dope more electrons than by replacing them with fluorine ions and thus raise the superconducting transition temperature in the end we were able as planned to more than double the previous concentration of electrons in the doped material but this did not have as great an effect as expected on the superconducting transition temperature however the use of negative hydrogen ions was linked to an unanticipated discovery that is we discovered a new region that displays superconductivity i decided to call it sc which cannot be seen when replacing electrons with fluorine ions see column we doped carriers into a parent material that possessed magnetism and when the magnetism disappeared superconductivity appeared until now there was agreement that ferrous materials can be used as a parent material in a state where they are not doped with carriers but in this research we ascertained that a parent material can also be in a state massively doped with carriers that is we understood that there exist two parent materials this is currently attracting attention in various places as a finding that will lead to new developments in superconductivity research i don t know what kinds of developments await but we are now in a situation where around every corner there is another corner waiting to be turned iron based superconductor research is going to get even more interesting from here on out hydrogen ions and the hosono style periodic table hydrogen usually becomes positive ions but actually it can also become negative ions i noticed this when i was doing research on changing the electrical properties of the cement material c a to be discussed in the second article i thought that someday i would be able to use negative ions of hydrogen h and indeed i eventually used them for injecting electrons into laofeas hydrogen appears at the top left of the regular periodic table but in my periodic table it is placed in the top middle because it becomes both positive and negative depending on the circumstances with regard to sc we wouldn t have been able to discover it if we hadn t had the idea of trying to use negative ions of hydrogen i take pride in the fact that this discovery was something that only we could have done after this region became known some people said various things such as there must be other domes too don t you think laughter maybe there are perhaps the hard part is only beginning column the discovery of a new superconductor mechanism the graph or phase diagram shows the extent of ion substitution and the relationship of this to superconducting critical temperature electrons were injected which increased the electron concentration in the oxypnictide compound lafeaso where the main constituent is iron in the graph in the gray dome on the left oxygen ions were replaced with fluorine ions in the pink dome on the right oxygen ions were replaced with negative hydrogen ions looking at the gray dome on the left side of the phase diagram it is apparent that when oxygen ions were replaced with fluorine ions electrons could only be injected up to a concentration of about percent this is because the oxygen cannot be replaced with fluorine to any greater extent it was thus impossible to know what happened on the right side of the phase diagram professor hosono reflected with such little information it s impossible to meaningfully discuss superconductivity but when oxygen ions o were replaced with negative hydrogen ions h it was possible to inject ions to a concentration of more than percent and he discovered that there is a second dome the pink one on the right side of the phase diagram why this came about in this way remains to be explained in the second of this two article series professor hosono discusses

shinjiro kanae literally bridging the arts and sciences issue professor shinjiro kanae department of civil engineering graduate school of science and engineering simulating the water cycle of the world as a whole the earth is often described as a planet of water water is indispensable for organisms including humans and that is why nasa tries to establish the existence of water when they search for extraterrestrial life on other planets and celestial bodies you have probably heard numerous reports of various global crises associated with water as well professor shinjiro kanae teaches and conducts research in the department of civil engineering with a focus on fresh water which is necessary for our daily lives he originally specialized in river engineering or river water in terms of civil engineering river water calls forth images of the construction and reinforcement of river banks and dams but there is much more to it than that water for a river sometimes comes from rain and sometimes from snow natural disasters attributed to global warming such as the unprecedented floods in thailand and the uk and the record breaking heavy snow in japan this year are occurring more frequently around the world in recent years we are doing research associated with such disasters one of kanae s main tools is large scale simulation based on information obtained from field surveys and satellite remote sensing for example let us imagine calculating the risk of flooding for all the rivers in the world first suppose we set the information for the catchment area of a river to one hundred to several hundreds of kilometers in scale then geographical information in km units captured by mesh segmentation is entered into a simulation even for the calculation of the flooding of rivers on a global scale this level of detailed geographical information is necessary in june kanae in collaboration with researchers from the university of tokyo and the university of bristol in the uk presented a paper titled global flood risk under climate change which was published in nature climate change the research incorporated changes in both natural and social conditions three alternatives at university although kanae is primarily and widely known as a river specialist his research is not limited to rivers but also includes various fields such as food and renewable energies however his scientific roots as a researcher originally go back to the field of civil engineering how did kanae get to where he is now upon reflection he believes it all started when he picked up a book about the state of the global environment in a bookstore when he was a high school student this was the time when concerns about the global environment started to gain attention as i began to read some of those books i became shocked and said to myself we are in big trouble today environmental problems are discussed even in middle and high schools but at that time there were almost no university faculties or departments with the word environment in their names when he entered natural sciences i at the university of tokyo after graduating from nada high school kanae had almost no interest in either the environment or civil engineering as a major however after he entered university he became more interested in these subjects as he read more books on the environment then he started to worry about the three alternatives he had when he went on to specialized coursework i wondered which way i should go the department of civil engineering or the department of geophysics earth and planetary sciences or even the department of forestry in the faculty of agriculture which is an unusual choice for students in natural sciences finally swayed by a photo of the kachidoki bridge in a civil engineering brochure i decided to enter the department of civil engineering in the end i became a researcher of rivers flowing under bridges laughter kanae smiles with an embarrassed look on his face the kachidoki bridge over the sumida river is known as one of the biggest bascule bridges in japan when he saw the rounded shape of the bridge his tuition told him that anyone who can create such a beautiful object can t be bad his decision was cemented as a matter of fact there is a sequel to this story nowadays i stay in contact with people every day through email in addition to civil engineers many of them are in geophysics or agriculture so regardless of the other routes i could have taken i would have arrived at almost the same place i m at now to the next stage kanae went on to graduate school at the university of tokyo which meant studying at the institute of industrial science then located in roppongi for his master s program afterwards he completed a doctoral program in the department of civil engineering at the university of tokyo and was promoted to and employed as an assistant professor at the institute of industrial science in he was assigned as a leader of the th project of the research institute for humanity and nature in kyoto and spent all his time going back and forth between kyoto and tokyo for about three and a half years at the busiest time i made round trips between tokyo and kyoto three times a week laughter he still loves kyoto because the old plans and facilities of past civil engineers continue to play a major role in the city landscape every now and then kanae makes one day trips to kyoto during the cherry blossom season or on other special occasions when looking around the streets of kyoto i am reminded that civil engineering designs time and space that can last a thousand years into the future after completing his assignment period kanae left kyoto and returned to the institute of industrial science at the university of tokyo he was then assigned as an associate professor to the graduate school of information science and engineering at tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech in and took on his current position in he is now planning new research themes aiming for breakthroughs in his new lab kanae also maintains his interest in the environment the working group ii s report vol the latest report prepared by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was approved at the th ipcc general meeting held in yokohama in march chapter of vol is the chapter on freshwater kanae s speciality field the fact that kanae s papers are frequently cited gives him considerable motivation meanwhile he considers having relationships with troubled sites in japan and abroad so important that he has joined the site inspection team for izu oshima islands after the landslide disasters civil engineering a world that bridges the arts and sciences kanae has been walking a straight line in the field of civil engineering ever since he was a university student however he notes that the subjects in the field have been changing bit by bit the term civil engineering often gives the impression of humble work such as dam construction however in fact the percentage of internationally active persons who majored in civil engineering is very high they share their expertise not only through technological assistance for development and environmental preservation in developing countries but also make contributions in many areas of civil planning beyond the purely technical the work of civil engineers also includes the rehabilitation of aging infrastructures and the restoration of nature in industrialized countries it is a field where you can be extremely active in cutting edge developments on the international stage it is also one of the most suitable fields for those who want to extend and utilize their expertise internationally in the future there is one final thing kanae would like to say to students as you know the school of engineering at tokyo tech has introduced an ao exam admissions office entrance exam in addition to the regular entrance exam i would like students who studied the arts in high school to also come to tokyo tech in order to develop infrastructure persons who can compute formulas are necessary of course however in addition to technology aspects grounded in the arts such as regional comprehensive planning and the analysis of human behavior are also very important the work of civil engineers is positioned between the arts and the sciences by its very nature in the future a new subject that cannot be simply categorized into either the arts or the sciences could still emerge i strongly hope that students who have a wide variety of interests will enter the world of civil engineering by taking advantage of the ao exam shinjiro kanae profile the special topics component of the tokyo tech website shines a spotlight on recent developments in research and

kenichi okada wiring the world wirelessly issue associate professor kenichi okada department of physical electronics graduate school of science and engineering millimeter waves realizing high speed and uninterrupted wireless transceivers please put on this white coat and cap and change your shoes before you enter the lab prompted by associate professor kenichi okada manager of the laboratory the interviewer slipped into a white coat this is for preventing dirt and dust from getting into the substrates of the circuits beyond the glass of the lab several students are looking into pc displays with solemn looks on their faces while operating a high frequency measuring transceiver their goal is to develop the world s fastest wireless transceiver with their own hands recent advances in wireless technologies such as mobile phones and wireless lan for pcs are truly eye opening by transmitting and receiving uninterrupted radio waves faster and farther we can send high capacity image data and watch videos on mobile device displays only ten years ago such an idea was totally beyond our imagination the key to the remarkable advances in wireless communications lies in the development of circuits utilizing high frequency waves currently the frequency band used for wireless communication devices such as mobile phones and wireless lan is under ghz gigahertz however since this frequency band is almost fully occupied by existing wireless communication devices only an extremely limited frequency range is available for each wireless communication standard under these circumstances an electromagnetic wave called a millimeter wave which has a wave length of mm and a frequency of ghz has recently attracted a great deal of attention around the world okada is currently a front runner in wireless technology research using millimeter waves controlling high frequency noise through the application of existing technologies millimeter waves provide a wide range of available frequencies and also have the potential to increase transmission speed radically however most of the millimeter wave wireless transceivers developed in the past were based on the heterodyne architecture which uses a two step process to convert the input signal frequency into a different frequency the problem with this method is its high power consumption and its need for many components to overcome such problems okada converted the signals for digital data to radio waves in one step by using direct conversion architecture which past studies have shown to be theoretically difficult additionally he succeeded in reducing circuit noise drastically by using a physical phenomenon known as injection locking we could increase communication speed unrestrictedly if it were not for noise however the bottleneck comes in that noise is hard to reduce it was the injection locking phenomenon that helped break this bottleneck as a matter of fact there is another important point here though the injection locking phenomenon itself has been known for a long time it too has a bottleneck with regard to control that is difficult to overcome when utilizing it in integrated circuits okada discovered a solution to this by applying reconfigurable technology originally the injection locking phenomenon utilized in integrated circuits behaves like a mischievous roughneck and it is difficult to make the circuits oscillate at the desired frequency laughter but our lab used reconfigurable technology to control the analog circuit properly through software and to flexibly vary the center frequency and band width of the wireless transmission reception in this way we reduced the noise moving one step closer to our dream in a session of the ieee international solid state circuits conference held in san francisco on february the research group of professor akira matsuzawa and okada et al made a presentation about the development of ghz billion hertz millimeter wave wireless transceivers that can transmit billion bits per second gb s this is the first ghz wireless transceiver in the world compatible with a qam modulation scheme that can transmit bits of information at one time up until now even with the fastest practical wireless lan standard only the mhz frequency band is available in the ghz band in this situation okada et al made a presentation that the ghz band frequency which has a range times wider than existing bands can be utilized with millimeter wave wireless communications using the ghz band mentioned above this means that a drastic improvement in wireless communication speed is coming closer to reality moreover this wireless transceiver can be implemented as a generally used cmos integrated circuit with a compact circuit area as small as mm and low power consumption it can be mounted in mobile devices such as mobile phones there is still much room for miniaturization of circuits in the future we can realize devices the size of a finger ring in terms of speed we can achieve instant access beyond the concept of a download my ultimate dream is to exceed wired communication in every respect eventually boyhood curiosity leads to wireless devices the first electronic device okada was interested in was hitachi s bit pc the basic master level this was delivered to his home when he was ten years old he said he was considerably intrigued as an elementary school student by the personal computer at a time when stand alone word processors were mainstream then he became a junior high school student and started to assemble a radio by himself that okada possessed the motivation to do this at such a time is evidenced in where he is today as a matter of fact i wanted to make a cordless telephone i tried hard to assemble it with transistors pulled out of a broken tv while referring to my junior high school textbook of technology and home economics i was so interested in mobile phones that i used one which i seized from my father when none of my friends even had them in fact nobody ever called me because the calling rate was too high laughter okada with his numerous achievements in the world of electronic devices stemming from his boyhood curiosity reflects that he could not have reached his current position today alone the current millimeter wave projects are led by the ministry of internal affairs and communications and there are many things that cannot be achieved without the cooperation of researchers in related fields and collaboration with companies moreover it is extremely discouraging when an expected result cannot be achieved okada says that his emotional support in such difficult times comes from his research students students are motivated by concrete goals for example rather than saying make lsi easier to use they are more motivated and find it more challenging to increase its speed tenfold it is really fun to do research with students like that and i m sure it provides motivation for both of us finally okada heartily encourages future students based on his own experiences technology in the future can be developed in your own way if you properly learn the basics and learn from failures and small successes on the way to your goal tokyo tech has a good environment and supportive colleagues to help you realize your ideas why not give tokyo tech a chance explanations

norichika kanie social and natural sciences to protect earth issue associate professor norichika kanie graduate school of decision science and technology pioneering a sustainable future through the commingling of economic development and environmental preservation in recent years we often hear the term sustainability when discussing environmental issues this word symbolizes our hope of preserving human prosperity while maintaining a globally sound environment for the future with the aim to provide the knowledge we need to tackle the most urgent challenges of the st century related to global sustainability an international collaborative research initiative future earth is stepping up its activities in what kind of difference is future earth trying to make in terms of environmental measures in order to realize human prosperity on earth economic activities and development are essential however hasty economic development results in environmental degradation such as air pollution and overflowing waste disposal plants in other words this theory indicates that economic development and the protection of the earth s environment stand in opposition to each other on the other hand the fundamental idea of sustainability is that we can achieve a good balance between the two if we reconsider our economies based on mass production and mass consumption and shift to environmentally friendly economic activities having said that when we look at the reality of tackling various issues related to the earth s system and human prosperity such as climate change mass extraction of natural resources and also at other global issues such as poverty and the financial crisis it appears difficult for each academic discipline to lead problem resolution in its individual field in light of this situation future earth offers a comprehensive approach grounded in transdisciplinarity as the last resort kanie who himself plays a major role in the project utters these words even more powerfully protecting the future of the earth with a fusion of methods from the social and natural sciences and from practice without the constraints of political power is imperative originally four international research initiatives were developed to counter change in the global environment kanie himself has been involved for a long time in one of the programs the earth system governance a core project of the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change ihdp which focuses on political science and international relations kanie still plays a key role in the project there were other initiatives which tried to coordinate various programs extending beyond the natural and social sciences however as each program had its own committee and own plans for activities they met with little success against such a background in june at the united nations conference on sustainable development rio future earth was launched as a ten year international research initiative future earth aims to coordinate different fields such as the natural and social sciences engineering and the humanities as required to provide scientific knowledge for its work it promotes planning through the collaboration of academia governments industries and civil societies in all regions of the world co designing and undertaking collaborative production activities or co producing it takes a completely different approach from conventional measures such as the kyoto protocol and the conference of the parties cop that are prone to be affected by national policies this method called transdisciplinarity is highly respected all around the world as a concept that coordinates bottom up ideas from a wide range of science communities as well as international environmental projects in a policy oriented manner another initiative that future earth has taken up as a flagship activity is sustainable development goals sdgs this agenda was developed at the united nations conference on sustainable development rio in to be taken up after the millennium development goals mdgs expire in kanie here again was appointed as the project leader for the project on sustainability transformation beyond by the ministry of the environment and is now working hard on compiling reports in order to contribute to the post development agenda s international development goals after in contrast to the millennium development goals which focus on the now we put a time dimension in the development goals and pursue system building that can be used in the future we will create transdisciplinary communities that put the social and natural sciences and practice together that proceed with monitoring and that will take action after optimum methods have been selected i understand that my mission is to harmonize the sustainable development goals with the direction future earth is taking allocation is the key to solving the issue of poverty kanie spent two years in jakarta indonesia as a third and fourth grader in elementary school due to his father s work as a university professor he points out that his experiences from that time considerably affected his philosophy later on in life it was comfortable in the residential area where we lived and my father s acquaintances and neighbors were all gentle and sincere however once we left the premises people did their washing in a dirty river while others used it as a toilet the gap was quite a shock for me this kind of poverty is a critical environmental problem the eradicate extreme poverty and hunger campaign has the highest priority out of the eight millennium development goals for example if global warming progresses further and rainfall patterns change more people in developing countries who live in drought prone lands may fall victim to ever more severe situations if they cannot harvest in the areas where they should be able to harvest the risk of starvation will drastically increase kanie thinks that this issue should be included and further developed in the new sustainable development goals as research advances we encounter allocation issues in numerous situations we encounter poverty and disparity on a global scale there is a sufficient amount of water and food but they are not sufficiently distributed in some areas in order to pursue a sustainable future we need to change our social systems the millennium development goals adopted commonly agreed upon goals for example they agreed to halve the proportion of people whose income is less than us dollar a day between and as a result many industrialized countries transferred technology and extended financing to developing countries among other things kanie thinks that by sharing this know how it may be possible to accelerate resolutions to problems something that otherwise could not be achieved by political negotiations alone after all i guess it is now high time for change to overcome the crisis that the earth system and the earth mechanism are carrying there are currently many issues that need to be addressed before it becomes too late we are aiming to solve these issues from the view point of governance a front runner in regarding the environment as essential for social and economic development kanie is actively working around the world to promote future earth lastly kanie has the following words for students who would like to follow in his footsteps in the future i am certain that the next ten years will be a turning point for change in the system surrounding environmental problems i think the younger generation today having grown up in the world with an awareness of the environment has the potential to create new ideas with a flexible mindset i would like them to believe in their own ideas and to develop groundbreaking methods one more thing i would like to say to them is not to forget to do research with your own feet if you come to a dead end make sure to go to the field and see the problem directly the clue to solving problems is found somewhere in the field in most cases explanations of technical terms future earth research for global sustainability the four international

misako takayasu a fractal view of big data phenomena issue associate professor misako takayasu department of computational intelligence and systems science interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering the enchantment of studying the unknown she squeezes out some tooth paste onto a plastic sheet and covers it with another piece of plastic slowly peeling it back she reveals an exquisite dendritic pattern i discovered the same type of pattern when cleaning the bathtub with my child after shaking some cleansing powder onto a sponge and i came up with a simple experiment to reproduce it says associate professor misako takayasu with a smile this incident speaks volumes about the way she engages in life s daily activities with eyes wide open and in happy pursuit of answers fractal geometry is a concept first introduced by french mathematician beno t mandelbrot the word fractal describes self similarity a complex patterning where any part extracted exhibits a pattern similar to the whole for example the line depicted by a ria coastline when viewed on a map forms an intricate shape and enlarging any part of it reveals the same complex pattern the extent of that complexity can be quantified and expressed volumetrically as fractal dimension takayasu first encountered fractals in as a new student at nagoya university mandelbrot s concept and chaos theory were just starting to attract attention within the scientific study of complex systems and fractal theory had not yet been seriously studied in japan takayasu had wanted to go beyond what she was learning in class to try her hand at more cutting edge research and fractals fit the bill perfectly during the summer of my first year at nagoya university i took a seminar led by fields medal winning mathematician heisuke hironaka called on the wings of mathematics and some of us decided to translate dr mandelbrot s the fractal geometry of nature scholars at the time read the book only in its original language so we went ahead and translated it into japanese i remember being so excited that even students could be a part of such advanced research takayasu recalls the independent study seminar later started by nagoya university students called the fractal study group ultimately led takayasu to begin her fractal studies in earnest fractals maximize system efficiency takayasu studied statistical physics at the condensed matter physics laboratory in nagoya university s department of physics which was conducting research closest to fractals at the time as a postgraduate at kobe university she went on to study aggregating systems with injection which is where fractals and statistical physics intersect through her work she attempted to answer why the distribution of aerosols fine particles floating in the atmosphere such as today s oft discussed pm follows a power law distribution that is fractal in nature while still a graduate student takayasu had the opportunity for a long term stay in the united states at both boston university and yale university as a visiting researcher the former is the home of influential statistical physicist harry eugene stanley and the latter is where fractal geometry s dr mandelbrot worked her dissertation was informed in large part by what she experienced at these universities the presence of fractals in every aspect of the natural world was a hot topic of study at the time and takayasu realized that it was of key importance to study systems that automatically maintained a fractal state thus she made that the focus of her research after obtaining her doctorate takayasu continued her studies in automobile traffic congestion phenomena and internet packet congestion phenomena at tohoku university and keio university as well as at future university hakodate she says that the statistical physics model she developed for automobile traffic congestion phenomena came to her when she was stuck with her family in a massive traffic jam while on a family trip what really causes traffic jams she wondered that turned into a family discussion of how cars will stop right away when you step on the brakes but take more time to accelerate when you step on the gas pedal the asymmetric nature of this relationship led takayasu to guess that this could be the essential cause of traffic congestion she says the model was fully formed in her head by the time she got home from the trip not long after this takayasu had the chance to talk with an information science expert and she learned that internet packets are very similar in nature to cars on a highway she decided that internet traffic congestion would be a good topic for study model analysis and measurements made it clear that the highest flow rate occurred during the critical borderline state between non congestion or low density packet traffic and congestion or high density traffic and that this was also the point at which the flow rate began to fluctuate in fractal patterns common sense tells us that fluctuation interferes with the mastery or control of a situation but efficiency is increased when fluctuation is being managed in fractals which should help us come to a logical understanding of why fractals exist across the board in the natural world in living organisms and even in human society not long after this takayasu had the chance to talk with an information science expert and she learned that internet packets are very similar in nature to cars on a highway she decided that internet traffic congestion would be a good topic for study model analysis and measurements made it clear that the highest flow rate occurred during the critical borderline state between non congestion or low density packet traffic and congestion or high density traffic and that this was also the point at which the flow rate began to fluctuate in fractal patterns common sense tells us that fluctuation interferes with the mastery or control of a situation but efficiency is increased when fluctuation is being managed in fractals which should help us come to a logical understanding of why fractals exist across the board in the natural world in living organisms and even in human society big data analysis contributes to the betterment of society the st century brought an explosion of subjects for fractal research with the appearance of big data or hugely massive and complex data sets the sheer size of the samples that can be taken from economic or social data that is generated in financial markets business transactions pos systems or in social media like twitter and blogs helps make it easier to recognize structures and correlations research at the takayasu lab today concentrates on taking a fractal view of various types of big data related phenomena and using statistical physics to develop models for example computer analysis performed on massive data sets from business transaction networks of roughly one million japanese companies reveals the scale free characteristic this term describes a fractal characteristic in that the number of companies engaging in transactions follows a power law basing the inquiry on the fact that atmospheric aerosol distribution follows power law and applying theoretical analysis of aggregating systems with injection takayasu proposed a mathematical model of a network of business transactions that takes into consideration new companies mergers acquisitions and bankruptcies in doing so she proved that a characteristic of the network would be its automatic convergence into a scale free steady state takayasu continues to research fractal characteristics and deviations from fractal models in price fluctuations in financial markets methodology developed in her lab for quantifying market stability is already in use in financial markets other research includes analysis of blogs and counting the number of times certain keywords like christmas or tsunami appear in the character strings entered every day by millions of people though it is difficult to predict the behavior of individual humans takayasu found that on a social scale the heightening of interest in or convergence of reaction to a particular event or accident is represented as a power law function takayasu thinks that by applying this finding we may be able to estimate how many people will be interested in a tsunami ten years from now going forward fractal analysis and statistical physics will help us explain not just social phenomena but ecosystems and other phenomena if we continue to collect observational data from a variety of fields says takayasu she is currently pursuing joint research on a practical level that is beyond the ordinary scope of scholarly activity such research includes for example doing economic data and blog analysis in collaboration with corporations the goal for takayasu and her students in the near future is to contribute to a more vibrant business economy and a more stable and secure society through the practical application of technologies they have developed the seeds of scientific study can be hidden in ordinary life and casual conversation the important thing is to think hard about whatever it is that you find interesting and never be afraid to ask questions takayasu has this to say to future scientists any time you approach a new challenge you will face difficulties many of my papers that i thought were major breakthroughs did not even make it to peer review i know that dr mandelbrot himself fought a lot of battles before his concept of fractals gained acceptance what seems outrageous today may become common sense in the future i hope that you keep dreaming of that day and keep chasing after what you believe the seeds of scientific study can be hidden in ordinary life and casual conversation the important thing is to think hard about whatever it is that you find interesting and never be afraid to ask questions glossarys fields medal a prize awarded once every four years to mathematicians not over forty years of age with outstanding achievements the fields medal is viewed as the most

all particles will aggregate after the passage of sufficient time however when new fine particles are injected into the system dust factory fumes etc particle size distribution is known to follow power law distribution power law power law is a probability distribution of random variables whereby one varies as a power of another it is frequently observed as the distribution of things physical and otherwise that differ in size by several orders of magnitude occurring in natural and social phenomena such as the size of craters on the moon the size of a catchment area for a river and the distribution of income most of these phenomena involve things that are small in size but also include a few that are significantly larger and account for most of the total effect research into power

michito yoshizawa novel nanostructures using self assembly issue associate professor michito yoshizawa chemical resources laboratory design of new functional molecules for nanoscience do you know how soap removes dirt michito yoshizawa s kind eyes sparkle for an instant as he picks up a molecular model in his lab at the chemical resources laboratory at the suzukakedai campus where he pours great energy into the development of functional molecules and materials which can respond to external stimuli and environmental change he cheerfully embarks on an explanation the soap we use is made chiefly of linear organic compounds one side is water unfriendly or hydrophobic and the other side water friendly or hydrophilic we call these kinds of compounds amphiphilic molecules and when we put them in water they come together and form spherical particles with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer surface this is known as a micelle the dirt that you wash off of your body or your dishes which is oily in nature enters into the inside of the micelle so when water is poured over our bodies or dishes or what have you they become clean that s the mechanism at work molecules that stand alone do not exhibit amazing properties but when they come together with others in a well ordered structure a few nanometers in size they can exhibit unusual phenomena the mechanism by which molecules automatically group together based on their mutual interactions to form a particular structure is called self assembly this phenomenon has been observed throughout living organisms for example in the double helix structure of dna or the tertiary structure of proteins it was once believed impossible to generate such structures artificially but that was before makoto fujita a professor of the university of tokyo and doctoral advisor to yoshizawa turned established theory on its head the pull of curiosity in the lab there is one thing in yoshizawa s curriculum vitae that immediately catches the eye for each of his degrees undergraduate master s and doctorate he worked in a different laboratory and university not unusual for students in other countries but quite a rare thing in japan yoshizawa did research in catalytic chemistry while earning his bachelor s degree at tokyo university of agriculture and technology and then attended tokyo tech where he began research in coordination chemistry for his master s degree as he conducted studies on enzyme mimetic metal complexes he felt the pull of research while at the same time growing gradually more confident about his skills as a researcher then as if by fate he had an encounter that led him to do the work he does today i was attending a summer session in the field of coordination chemistry and i heard professor fujita give a lecture there it really blew me away he was starting up his own research lab at the time and he was looking for students who might want to join well i took the bait and got reeled in laughter after finishing his master s degree yoshizawa transferred to nagoya university where fujita was and there he studied supramolecular chemistry as a doctoral student with his doctorate in engineering he followed fujita to the university of tokyo where he continued doing research as a post doctoral researcher and assistant professor he subsequently came back to tokyo tech this time as an associate professor he moved around quite a bit it wasn t because i couldn t get along with my advisors or anything yoshizawa protests a smile on his face it was definitely hard at times to leave work and places that i was familiar with but i would do my best at the next place and then my former professors and colleagues would try to meet with me at conferences the connections don t stop when you go someplace new you re still in research and people remain concerned about you and cheer you on that support has meant a great deal to me by studying at each of these places putting his full effort into doing research with his advisors and achieving his targeted results yoshizawa has earned the trust of others in his field and gained confidence in his own ability to do research the keywords easy to do and water figure a conventional micelle and b mimetic diagram of the nanocapsule developed by yoshizawa et al at present yoshizawa s attention is focused on research involving anthracene anthracene is an organic compound consisting of three fused benzene rings in a sheet which shines blue under ultraviolet light the objective is to create nanostructures in various forms such as capsules and tubes through the skillful exploitation of anthracene s shape and properties we are using a self assembly technique to connect sheets of anthracene molecules together into three dimensional structures which resemble fullerenes or carbon nanotubes in shape the idea is that this might make it easy to create nanostructures with novel capabilities well designed new molecules are prepared they then come together spontaneously based on their intermolecular interactions forming nanostructures with intriguing functions in january of this year yoshizawa together with group members published their

nanostructures are more stable and there is greater control over size than has been the case with usual micelles in addition the nanocapsules prepared by yoshizawa et al encapsulate various colored molecules in water and emit a unique fluorescence through efficient interactions between the anthracene shells and the encapsulated molecules this ability to create structures as easily as micelles structures containing various capabilities not available in micelles carries great promise for applications with new optical materials water is key in the research we are doing when you consider that it is something we all use wherever we are and that it s much better for the environment than using organic solvents we hope to see broader applications of this technology in the future the field of medical care where a drug could for example deliver medicine to a specific part of the body via a nanocapsule is another area where we would like to see application of this research chemistry is the

fields together with fujita in this front runner in the field of chemistry from whom much is still expected has a surprising past my parents were both math teachers so i was actually better at math than chemistry yoshizawa smiles not to say that i didn t like chemistry yoshizawa somehow got into science but it wasn t until he was at university that he truly felt its full allure his interest in science only grew as he began to pursue his own research in the lab there are still so many depths to explore in chemistry so much yet that remains unknown chemistry is about making things and creating things is fundamentally interesting work especially if you can make something no one has ever made before i think in creating you continue to grow yourself in wrapping up yoshizawa extends an

akira ohtomo pioneering next generation electronic materials issue professor akira ohtomo department of applied chemistry graduate school of science and engineering contributing to improvement of the quality of metal oxides in a laboratory in a research building in the ookayama south area in a room that is quiet except for the humming of experimental apparatus a student is avidly staring into a monitor i m just observing the condition of the crystals using combinatorial chemistry i techniques crackling sounds are emitted from the laser that is employed for vaccum deposition of the solids it has been nearly years since akira ohtomo head of the laboratory became involved in research on the application of metal oxides to next generation high performance electronic devices currently mainstream materials used for semiconductor industry are non oxides such as silicon synthesized through the reduction of minerals such as metal oxides metal oxides are used as insulators to store static electricity in small parts of the devices or to prevent the flow of current on the one hand there were high hopes for metal oxides to be used in a variety of applications in electronics as they exhibit a wide range of properties ranging from those of insulators to superconductors and even to magnets next generation high performance electronic devicehowever because many impurities and defects form on the interfaces of different oxides it has not been possible for them to be applied to next generation high performance electronic devices which require structures with few impurities over a large area given the current state of metal oxides ohtomo sought to improve the quality of their crystal structures after many repeat trials and many new ideas of his own ohtomo s research results completely overturned current knowledge he discovered the world s first metallic interface in the junction between insulators which was thought to be impossible for this series of research results he was awarded the th japan academy medal prize in february previously the focus was on the structural properties of metal oxides such as heat resistance and hardness but in my case i put them together in multilayers in a form of thin pure crystals called thin films and investigated the electrical properties at their interface i discovered the phenomenon that while both layered crystalline structures were insulators they were able to conduct electricity at their interface due to the presence of high mobility electron gas i also discovered the intriguing phenomenon that the electrons in one side that spill over to the other side due to the charge imbalance form two dimensional electrons at the interface unlike the mechanism that was previously assumed early interests sparked by expo space shuttles and the superconductivity boom there were several factors that led to ohtomo getting involved in the world of semiconductor development first in tracing his roots we are taken back to his final years in primary school from march to september the international science and technology exposition tsukuba expo was held in tsukuba science city ohtomo who had just started junior high school at the time visited the venue many times during that period accompanied by his father my father and i went there at least five times in total maybe because it was close to my house but my father was also an electrical engineer so he must have been interested in it too his interest in electronics was so strong that on weekends he used to tell me about the circuits and cathode ray tubes in televisions when i was only in primary school ohtomo reflects fondly the expo showcased an array of pioneering technology gathered from around the world in addition this was the time when the space shuttle program which was launched in dominated everyday conversations by the end of the high temperature superconductivity boom was in full swing i wanted to get involved in all kinds of new technology too young ohtomo s dreams grew bigger in his university entrance examination ohtomo had initially applied to the th academic group the field of mechanical engineering at tokyo institute of technology this decision was rooted in his admiration for the structure of space shuttles and the desire to get involved in the construction of such complex systems himself in the end however he chose to enter the nd academic group the field of materials which had been his second choice but was very much in line with his original dreams the tiles covering all over the space shuttles are ceramics i thought that if i research ceramics in the department of inorganic materials i might be able to get involved in space shuttle development in the future a decisive encounter occurred when he was a rd year student ohtomo who studied at the ookayama campus at the time became interested in the superconductivity laboratory which he learned about during yacht club camp he visited the laboratory in suzukakedai and immediately thought this is right for me and decided to enter this laboratory at the time hideomi koinuma the authority in the field was supervising there i think it was when we went out for a drink when professor koinuma suddenly said let s create electronics with metal oxides at the time this was said to be impossible so i was surprised this is where my research started drawing out the true potential of oxides and turning dreams into reality currently there are three main research themes that ohtomo is working on the first is photocatalysis a process in which chemical reactions are brought about through sunlight in recent years photocatalysts have come into commercial use one example is titanium dioxide on toilets which acts as an antibacterial a property of titanium dioxide is its ability to break down harmful organic compounds when it is irradiated with ultraviolet light in this way a titanium dioxide coating effectively keeps toilets clean ohtomo continues to look ahead to make a chemical reaction happen through the absorption of visible light we actually need a non transparent material however titanium dioxide is a colorless clear material so there is only a small catalytic reaction with visible light the search for a non transparent material that works as a catalyst for photolysis of water with visible light is now attracting world attention as the non transparent photocatalytic material ohtomo is focusing on iron rust if his persistence in improving the quality of metal oxide crystals pays off they may be applied to the development of cars that can run on solar power alone for example the iron rust that we find around us can be used as a material to generate electricity it is a dream like scenario that makes us appreciate the potential of catalytic chemistry the second theme is the research and development of power devices currently there is a lot of focus on silicon carbide sic as a next generation power semiconductor with low electrical power loss ohtomo is conducting research in a collaborative team which has discovered a material better than silicon carbide and is now investigating it the third theme revolves around making electronic circuits on glass substrates and is an extension of something called graphoepitaxy graphoepitaxy is a technique that was trendy in the s and used in growing high quality semiconductors whereby glass surfaces were made bumpy so that a layer of simple crystals called thin films would form in this way many overlapping layers of simple crystal thin film semiconductors can be obtained with this technique it became possible to create large area semiconductor substrates at a lower cost which can then be used in applications such as substrates for solar cells and liquid crystal displays by applying nanofabrication techniques to the glass surface the synthesis progresses with the crystals arranged in arrays in this way you can create low cost semiconductor substrates the world would be quite different if you could make semiconductor substrates similar in quality to silicon wafers ii but the size of a tatami mat approximately m for yen ohtomo s eyes lit up finally ohtomo offers words of encouragement to students who have high hopes for the future i often tell students what matters most in research is allowing yourself to be inspired and having reserves of strength for the duration because life is a long race you have to enjoy research to do this i want them to embrace new perspectives and make new discoveries if you think of something yourself and realize it you are left with excitement and a feeling of fulfillment these experiences inspire although in reality most of the time you fail however if you give up there you can t experience the enjoyment of inspiration so i don t want them to forget their reserves of strength and the prospect of a long race ohtomo himself has not always travelled an easy road when he belonged to bell laboratories in the u s as a postdoctoral member of the technical staff he was troubled by the differences in research culture and was distressed by an incident involving a colleague there who fabricated research papers it was a mental blow perhaps it was his strong mind which he cultivated during his time in the yacht club that helped him to persevere through these difficult times if you have a positive outlook and a resilient attitude in the face of defeat where it is ok to fail now as long as you succeed later the results will follow by themselves i still believe this to be true i the technique where many groups of compounds are synthesized efficiently based on combinatorics and using them according to different purposes ii an artificial crystal that is processed into sheet form and is vital for integrated circuit technology without this the it society of today could not have been established akira ohtomo profile major awards the special topics component of

shigeo hirose relentless passion for the creation of robots our mission is to solve the problems japan faces today robot research can be summed up simply as the study of achieving a specific goal the reason for creating a robot in the first place of course is very important there are plenty of interesting areas of research that may not be particularly useful to society but my personal motivation in studying robots has always been to create something truly useful to people essentially i wanted to use my knowledge and skills to some purposeful end therefore it did not necessarily have to be in the field of robotics a robot scientist internationally renowned for his development of many unique robots hirose comments on his purpose in studying robots he continues by saying at the moment japan is facing many daunting problems among these are the post accident cleanup at fukushima no nuclear plant and dealing with aging infrastructures and buildings typified by the recent collapse of the sasago tunnel i believe that offering optimal solutions to pressing problems like these is the mission that people like myself and my colleagues at tokyo institute of technology have been assigned i firmly believe that only when we fulfill this mission can we expect to be recognized by people in society it was april when hirose joined the department of control engineering in tokyo institute of technology s graduate school of science and engineering as a graduate student specializing in mechanical and control engineering he successfully completed his doctorate in after successively serving as assistant and associate professor in he became a professor in the department of mechanical sciences and engineering now the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering soon to celebrate his th birthday hirose will end the robot scientist chapter of his life at tokyo institute of technology which spans more than years during his time at the institute professor hirose mentored doctoral students and more than master s degree students upon retirement hirose plans to carry on his activities in robot research from his new base at hibot a venture company launched by graduates and visiting international students from hirose s laboratory at tokyo institute of technology hibot an abbreviation of hirose laboratory robot is an enterprise that engages in the development and sale of cutting edge robots as well as control and drive components essential for robotic control acm r is an amphibian snake like robot the mechanism the snake uses to propel itself by wriggling its body is almost the same on land and in water to simulate this mechanism hirose attached paddle blades to the sides of the robot s body to create an edge against the water for propulsion he then attached small wheels to the paddle blades to enable the robot to move swiftly on the ground as well through hibot hirose has already received numerous requests from various groups for advice in relation to the accident at the nuclear power plant in fukushima this is because there are so many pressing tasks at the site of the accident that can only be performed by remote controlled robots such as the removal of radioactive contaminants inside nuclear reactors and the subsequent dismantling of the nuclear reactors themselves people are pinning their hopes in particular on the snake like amphibian robot the acm r as the only robot capable of carrying out this mission acm r was first introduced to the public at the aichi expo in japan where it attracted considerable attention at the site of the nuclear power plant accident where rubble is still scattered about and contaminated water has leaked a robot capable of penetrating through gaps as small as centimeters is needed to assess internal conditions at the moment acm r is considered to be the only robot capable of conducting such a mission a snake like robot that astounded scientists of robot technology around the world it was the acm iii a snake like robot completed in that first made hirose s name widely known in the field of robot research this robot is the forerunner of acm r at that time i was just about the only one studying snake like robots worldwide so no matter what conference i took my robot to it always attracted attention hirose recalls in fact the very reason hirose decided to do his master s at tokyo institute of technology was because he wanted to create a soft flexible machine being of the sputnik generation i was interested in space and rockets as a student at yokohama national university when i looked at my fellow students nearby creating robots i couldn t help but think how boring their work was one day however as i was reading a book by professor emeritus masahiro mori of tokyo institute of technology who was known by the nickname dr robocon i noted in particular his description of the excitement of soft flexible machines and i suddenly had a strong desire to create with my own hands machines that were soft and flexible i then joined the laboratory of professor yoji umetani at the institute where my first challenge was to develop a snake like robot there were two main reasons for choosing a snake for the motif of my robot the first was my aspiration as an engineer i felt that perhaps if i succeeded in creating a long thin robot capable of smooth supple movement it could be useful in various applications such as disaster rescues or inspecting piping for example at the same time i had an interest in snakes from the perspective of physical science i wanted to explore from a mechanical perspective how without any legs they can move so quickly and smoothly climbing up trees or swimming in water in when hirose began his research and development of robots not a single scientist was engaged in studying the mechanisms of a snake s movements from the perspective of mechanics therefore hirose had to start his project by investigating and analyzing in detail an actual snake s movements at that time there was a restaurant in miyamasuzaka in the shibuya district that served snake dishes i found out that this restaurant also sold live snakes so i went there right away to purchase some in all i bought perhaps six or seven japanese striped snakes elaphe quadrivirgata that cost me yen each hirose comments releasing a snake onto a stretch of artificial turf hirose began to observe its movements with enthusiasm the moment hirose picked up one of the snakes he noticed that the edge of its belly was shaped like the blade of an ice skate the structure of the scales on the snake s belly facilitates smooth forward and backward movement however the edge of the belly itself is angular and serves a purpose similar to that of the edge of an ice skate allowing the snake to gain propulsion from it according to the same principle to study the movement of a snake s musculature in detail hirose attached a number of electromyographs to the snake s body and recorded and analyzed the data sometimes he attached the shed skin of a snake to a wooden block the same weight as the snake and experimented by pulling it he also placed obstacles such as pieces of wood or marbles on the artificial turf to investigate how the snake moved among or over them in addition hirose discovered that although a snake does not lift its body when moving slowly it bends its body significantly and partially lifts it when moving swiftly hirose felt that there must be a mechanical reason for this and tried to shed light on this point he also found that the curves the snake makes when moving also followed a certain law of nature this resulted in his establishment of a mathematical formula which he named the serpenoid curve as he explored the mechanisms of a snake s body movement hirose went ahead and developed a snake like robot out of aluminum and steel i will never forget the excitement at the time of the acm iii s trial run on december this machine was just like a snake and started to move with the suppleness of a living creature i was instantly mesmerized by this robot hirose continued his observation of snakes and improved his snake like robot in he was awarded his doctorate largely in recognition of these achievements after this hirose continued his efforts and working jointly with students in his laboratory he developed a range of unique snake like robots among these are the acm r a robot that can work adeptly in locations with many obstacles and the slim slime a unique snake like robot that moves by expanding and contracting through the use of air pressure one of these the acm r is expected to be used for cleanup operations at the fukushima no nuclear power plant at the beginning of its development we thought that its scope of application in disaster rescue work could be broadened by making it an amphibian machine and i was very pleased to find out that it just so happens that it will be very useful in the post accident cleanup work at the nuclear power plant applying the principles of his snake like robots hirose also developed a hand type robot that can grasp things gently and an arm type robot that stretches out lithely during operation at the request of the nissan motor company in hirose developed robots based on the principles of these two robots to assist workers at automobile assembly plants and received the carlos ghosn award for his outstanding contribution in tandem with the development of snake like robots hirose also started developing a robot that climbs up stairs on legs after coming across a daddy longlegs on one occasion hirose became keenly interested in its mechanical movements and set about developing a robot with six legs based on this insect in the second model he completed in hirose succeeded in getting the robot to climb an entire set of stairs without falling by outfitting it with tactile sensors this robot caught the attention of a professor from ohio state university and led to an invitation for hirose to participate in a project by darpa defense advanced research project agency in responding to requests from governments and private sector companies hirose continued to develop robots one after another throughout his career many of these were designed to take the place of humans in scouting and observation work at sites where it is too dangerous for humans to work robots he developed include robots for removing anti personnel mines planet exploration robots underwater exploration robots and robots to work inside plumbing pipes it is estimated that professor hirose has developed well in excess of robots countless failures but never one setback whatever the circumstances hirose effortlessly appears to be a fount of creativity with one unique idea after another simply bubbling to the surface when asked about this he replied nonchalantly in my case i think you could say my situation is like the well known story of unkei i feel i simply give form to images that well up in my mind just as they appear in fact in my research on robots the most enjoyable time for me is the moment that an image appears in his novel ten nights of dreams the author natsume soseki describes unkei a genius sculptor of buddhist statues during the kamakura period like this as the main character of the story watches unkei sculpt a statue of the two guardian deva kings the man standing next to him exclaims all that unkei is doing is simply digging out the figures buried inside the timber but even with someone like hirose it would be a rare robot to reach completion in the exact image of its original conception because a robot is an entire system it cannot be completed if even one small part of it does not function having to rebuild the whole thing from scratch due to a minor adjustment is a daily occurrence in our work because of this i have had countless failures throughout my career but i have never had even one setback the moment a failure occurs all i can think of is what i can do to succeed says hirose matter of factly this frame of mind is what continually opens new pathways for hirose hirose is relentless in his efforts to improve his robots even after completion this is why the development of more than a few of his robots is an ongoing process that takes years or more hirose s laboratory is crowded with such robots furthermore while it is a fact that i have started the development of some of my robots with a snake or spider in mind i certainly do not believe that anyone should adhere to one idea as a source of inspiration it does not really matter from what source you draw inspiration what is important is the purpose in developing the robot this is why i try to make students who come to my laboratory think deeply about what they hope to achieve through their research on robots so that they will think carefully about their direction and goals for example there are some researchers who are developing robots that can iron clothes the reason people iron clothing is to smooth out the wrinkles in the cloth but my view of this situation would be that it is smarter to develop materials that do not require ironing such as shape memory fiber this is why i cannot blindly go along with the idea of having robots take over work originally done by humans efforts to foster the development of the next generation from children to graduate students what kind of knowledge and skills are needed to become a robot scientist hirose replies it goes without saying that theoretical knowledge such as mathematics and physics are essential but i also believe engaging in creative activities from childhood such as handicrafts is vital more than anything these activities help children develop their perception of form and movement in a visual three dimensional way often in the past when i wanted to share an image with students i felt unable to do so easily as they lacked these tactile experiences this was frustrating at times in the end some students even suggested professor how about using a mathematical formula to illustrate it as a child hirose was the type of boy who preferred playing indoors and doing handicrafts rather than running around outdoors he not only enjoyed taking clocks apart but also making things like radios with his own two hands when he was in high school one of his chores at home was to fill the bath with water each day forgoing the use of electronic circuits he challenged himself to create a device that would whistle when the water in the bathtub reached a certain level hirose is keen to help children learn the joy and importance of creating things with their own hands this is why he has been hosting the robot grand prix sponsored by the japan society of mechanical engineers and has served as chairman of the organizing committee since hirose contributed significantly to the establishment of the integrated creative workshop in the ishikawadai building on the okayama campus the department of mechanical sciences and engineering the predecessor of department of mechanical and aerospace engineering focused primarily on theory while practical production was considered somewhat inferior believing both aspects to be important hirose encouraged the department to raise money and refurbished an old building in which to set up a studio which was later merged with another studio and became the integrated creative workshop today this workshop is a center for creative education where various activities and events such as the street performance robot contest are held hirose is also passionate about the education of the next generation that broadly includes young people of all ages from elementary school children to high school students to graduate students in doctoral courses he devotes himself to promoting education through his work as chairman of the national boys and girls challenge creation contest sponsored by the japan institute of invention and innovation as professor of the super robotics program at the waseda prep school he also aims to inspire teens to become top engineers capable of solving problems in society i feel ever so grateful to tokyo institute of technology for allowing me to pursue my study of robots for the past years i will not be idle even after my retirement with renewed determination i intend to continue to devote my efforts to the research and development of robots that will be useful to society and also to the education of the next generation says hirose filled with both a sense of satisfaction and conviction about his mission shigeo hirose major awards the special topics component of the tokyo tech website shines a spotlight on recent developments in research and education achievements of its

kei hirose unveiling the mysteries of post perovskite the most signifcant discovery in the history of earth science in years in my work over the years i have always tried to demonstrate my own particular strengths and this approach led me to new discoveries that i had never imagined for a scientist this is a great thrill these are the words of professor hirose spoken in a nonchalant manner while he makes his achievements sound effortless putting this philosophy into practice has been no easy task the strength of hirose perhaps lies in his ability to realize what he sets out to do hirose s area of specialization is earth science in his work he attempts to better understand how the earth began what state it is in at present and what it will be like in the future by investigating the interior of the earth leading the world in a number of groundbreaking discoveries in earth science over the years hirose has shed new light on earth science history in recognition of his outstanding achievements he has received numerous awards including the prestigious ibm japan science prize and in at the young age of the japan academy prize one particularly outstanding achievement that has attracted the attention of researchers all over the world as the most significant discovery in the history of earth science in years is his work on post perovskite which was published in the science journal science in may the nature of the earth s lowermost mantle at a depth of to km from the surface has long been mysterious because many features of seismological observations of this region remain unexplained through his work hirose succeeded in identifying the material of the lowermost mantle for the first time which is now called post perovskite the radius of the earth is approximately km the interior of the earth is huge and consists of three layers in order from the center they are the core comprised of metals the mantle comprised of rock and the crust or the layer on which we live a depth of to km corresponds to the bottom part of the rocky mantle overlying the metallic core hirose explains we know that the interior of the earth is actually divided into many layers just like an onion when you peel away these layers one at a time from the outside in the same way you would peel an onion s skin you finally come to the core the mantle above the core is also divided into four layers and by we had identified what the first three layers were made of when it comes to the lowest layer the fourth layer however there were all kinds of hypotheses but they all remained in the realm of conjecture this is why i wanted to elucidate the true nature of this material that formed the fourth layer interior of the earth which is divided into many layers of various constituent materials and crystal structures aiming straight for the bottom of the mantle for the first two years of undergraduate study my grades were poor so it was impossible for me to get into the popular departments says hirose what supposedly led him to choose the path of geology was the limited choice available to him as an undergraduate student at the university of tokyo in choosing a department he had only two options to pursue either mathematics or geology in the end he chose the geology department because he had no aspiration to follow in the footsteps of his father who was a mathematician the prospect of being able to travel to various places under the guise of geological research also aroused his interest in geology in reality however the research lab he entered performed experimental studies and he was involved in little fieldwork during his student days at the university of tokyo hirose studied magma formed near the surface layer of the earth using the magma producer available in the laboratory at his own initiative he took up a concept that his academic supervisor had been mulling over for more than years but had never tried surprisingly hirose succeeded in achieving the dream of his mentor reflecting on this time in his life hirose says i believe this experience of success marked the beginning of my own determination as a scientist to take up for the first time in the world experiments that nobody had ever attempted in however when hirose left the university of tokyo to become an assistant professor in the department of earth and planetary sciences school of science at tokyo institute of technology he decided to conclude his study of magma and focus on a new topic of research it was then he decided to research deeper areas of the earth his rationale at that time was that since he was going to probe deeper areas of the earth he might as well aim for a much deeper place than anyone had ever attempted before elaborating on his rationale at the time hirose explains all kinds of phenomena are occurring in the boundary region between the earth s crust where we live and the atmosphere when i considered the earth as a whole and the place where the most important processes are occurring it became clear that it is the boundary region between the earth s core and the mantle that was also one of the reasons why i decided to aim for the bottom of the mantle in my research the question then was how to aim for a depth of greater than km most likely the first idea that springs to anyone s mind is digging however even the chikyu the deep sea drilling vessel that boasts the world s highest drilling capability is able to reach a depth of only about km it is also a well known fact that the closer we get to the center of the earth the higher the temperature and pressure become this is where high temperature and high pressure apparatus comes into the picture pressure at the earth s core reaches about million atmospheric pressures and the temperature reaches more than k kelvin absolute temperature therefore scientists who study the interior of the earth go about their research by recreating the conditions at the interior of the earth they do this by conducting high temperature high pressure experiments inside laboratories a crucial point of their research is how successfully they can create high temperature and high pressure conditions one way they do this is through the use of a device called a diamond anvil cell where a sample is placed between two diamonds and compressed a laser beam is then applied to heat the sample after that the sample is analyzed at the spring synchrotron radiation facility using a high power x ray to determine into what kind of crystal structure the sample has been transformed the diamond anvil cell is a device that applies pressure to a sample by placing the sample between two diamonds and compressing it from both the top and bottom the diamonds in this device are sided pyramids with slightly flattened tips to aim for conditions like those found at the bottom of the mantle it was necessary to reach million atmospheric pressures and a temperature of k to learn experimental methods using the diamond anvil cell hirose decided to first master basic techniques by taking up a position as a visiting investigator at the geophysical laboratory of the carnegie institution in washington d c he held this position for a year and a half from upon returning to japan he began full scale high temperature high pressure experiments elucidating the bottom of the mantle and on to the deepest part of the earth realizing a temperature and pressure equivalent to those found at a depth of km is no small feat but hirose never faltered in his single minded devotion to this goal after a long period of trial and error he finally succeeded in realizing million atmospheric pressures and a temperature of k with his heart pounding hirose viewed the analytical results of the material that had formed and was astounded before his eyes appeared a material with a crystal structure that nobody had ever imagined he realized that this material named post perovskite by hirose could offer an extremely detailed explanation of that part of the earth that had remained a mystery until then are you familiar with a type of rock called mica that peels into thin layers like paper we discovered that post perovskite has a crystal structure just like mica and conducts electricity and heat very well explains hirose after this hirose continued to set and break his own records in high temperature and high pressure experiments in april he finally succeeded in achieving a pressure and temperature condition beyond million atmospheric pressures and k in other words he recreated the conditions at the center of the earth for the first time in the history of the world as a result of this achievement he ascertained that the material at the inner core of the earth has a hexagonal close packed structure where the iron atoms bond at high density there were four factors that enabled our laboratory to always be first at setting new records the strong passion of our team members to reach our goals at all costs the grinding and polishing engineers with brilliant techniques in small factories who continuously honed their skills in grinding and polishing diamonds the synchrotron radiation facility spring which boasts the world s highest efficiency and above all the dedication of the students at tokyo institute of technology who relentlessly persevered in silence without becoming discouraged when faced with repeated failures beams hirose there must have been countless failures behind the shadow of success but hirose smiles calmly without showing even a trace of such hardship post perovskite discovered in without knowledge of earth science it is impossible to explain the history of evolution of life the discovery of post perovskite has led to many other revelations one that caught the attention of hirose is the possibility of a correlation between the evolution of earth and life the earth s core consists of two types of matter an outer core of molten metal and an inner core of solid metal it had previously been assumed that the emergence of the inner core occurred about billion years ago hirose s research however revealed that the formation of the inner core was facilitated by post perovskite and it is now believed that the formation of the earth s core may have occurred as recently as million to one billion years ago about million years ago is the time when the so called biological explosion known as the cambrian explosion occurred also life emerged on land soon after that the formation of the earth s inner core and such evolution of life may be linked with each other the history of the evolution of life should have reflected the change in environments at the earth s surface which is strongly controlled by the interior of the earth when viewed over a long period of time to shed light on the most fundamental mystery of mankind regarding when and where life originated and how it evolved we must unlock the secrets of earth s history declares hirose in a project merging earth science with life science was launched by the earth life science institute elsi elsi is a joint research center of tokyo institute of technology ehime university institute for advanced study and harvard university it was selected in for the world premier international research center initiative wpi program promoted by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology as the director of this initiative hirose says with great enthusiasm we want to accelerate the elucidation of the mysteries of the origins of earth and life hirose has the following message for would be scientists of the next generation the most important things for a scientist are enthusiasm effort and a little bit of luck moreover in everything you do it is important to first meet the challenge without making up your mind at the outset that it is impossible this simple way of looking at things will change your life significantly if some of you hold the view that you may not be able to pursue the scientific path just because your grades aren t good get rid of such a silly notion immediately and instead pursue every challenge that comes your way when you do that the path to the future will naturally open up before you professor kei hirose director earth life science institute world premier international research center initiative wpi launched

yoshinori ohsumi elucidating the mechanism of autophagy the most basic function of cells that is common to both plants and animals we live in a peaceful world if you want to achieve great things however you really have to think outside the box professor yoshinori ohsumi is a soft spoken man who speaks dispassionately behind the calm exterior however is a man on a mission the inamori foundation s th kyoto prize presentation ceremony was held on november candidates for the prize are individuals or groups who have made lifetime contributions to the development of science technology and the arts professor ohsumi was among the recipients he was the first person in the world to visually observe the function of autophagy self cannibalization whereby cells placed in a state of starvation degrade parts of themselves to serve as nutrient sources and so stave off starvation he then elucidated the mechanism of autophagy and the genes involved professor ohsumi initially studied yeasts however he concluded that the phenomenon of autophagy was not confined to yeasts but is one of the most basic cell functions found in a variety of organisms from plants right up to humans this set off the current boom in research into autophagy around the world publications on autophagy have grown from around ten per year in the early s to over per year at present and the number continues to grow rapidly professor ohsumi describes the situation this way as research into autophagy has expanded it has become clear that it is not simply a response to starvation it also contributes to a range of physiological functions such as inhibiting cancer cells and aging eliminating pathogens and cleaning the insides of cells we have also begun to see a small explosion in research that demonstrates a new function with the knocking out genes that contribute to autophagy however there is still much we do not know about the mechanism of autophagy and this calls for serious study i hope to go on to study autophagy at the molecular level to tackle the mechanism head on that is my mission the challenge of doing what no one else is doing professor ohsumi became involved with autophagy in after earning his doctor of science in physiology from the graduate school of science at the university of tokyo he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the rockefeller university in the us he returned to the university of tokyo working first as a research associate and then as a lecturer in the faculty of science in he was appointed associate professor in the college of arts and sciences at the university of tokyo at the age of this was the first laboratory that he ran he had been working on the transport of materials to the vacuoles in yeasts in the botany laboratory under professor now emeritus professor yasuhiro anraku but decided to turn this over to professor anraku s laboratory and set out on a new project it was then he decided to elucidate the mechanism of the the degradative function of the vacuoles in yeasts which later tied in to his research on autophagy while working in professor anraku s laboratory i chose the transport of materials to the yeast vacuoles as my research project because no one else was studying it professor ohsumi said vacuoles are a type of organelle in living things and they are limited by vacuolar membranes they are filled with cell sap or mostly salts solution especially they account for around of the cell volume in plants back in the s vacuoles were simply regarded as inert organelles and the repositories of wastes in the cells however when ohsumi was attempting to isolate the nuclei in yeast cells as a postdoctoral fellow at the rockefeller university he found a layer of clearly concentrated organelles at the top layer in centrifuge tube that was to be discarded and noticed that these were vacuoles he wondered whether or not these vacuoles played an important role in the cells upon leaving rockefeller university and returning to the faculty of science at the university of tokyo ohsumi began serious research into yeast vacuoles he was the first to discover that yeast vacuoles actively transport substances such as amino acids and play a role in the homeostasis of metabolites and ions this brought him considerable success and has shaped his approach to research that of undertaking what no one else was doing ever since i started out with a love of the microscope vacuoles are the only organelle visible under the light microscope and i often observed them my observations under the microscope were the main reason i was able to discover these hitherto unknown functions of vacuoles he said yeast vacuole in a state of starvation as seen with an electron microscope the large white circles inside the cell are vacuoles and we know that a portion of the cellular material is found inside them doing something no one else is doing was also the motivation behind choosing to elucidate the mechanism of lytic function of yeast vacuoles when be branched out on his own in vacuoles are organelles that not only store waste materials inside cells but also contain various degradative enzymes however what was degraded inside the vacuoles and how it was done were still complete mysteries in those days at first professor ohsumi considered whether it would be possible to observe what was occurring inside the vacuole under a microscope in the absence of nutrients yeasts fall into a state of starvation next they then turn to forming spores inside the cells which allows the cells to ride out the starvation he thought that if vacuoles had a degradative function it would probably become most active in a state of starvation when the cells were forming spores if it were possible to halt the lytic function in the vacuoles it should then be possible to discover what was being degraded he procured mutant yeasts which had no hydrolytic enzymes in their vacuoles and using a light microscope he began observing what occurred in the vacuoles during the state of starvation this was when he discovered autophagy when a yeast cell is starved double membrane structures will appear within the cell the double membrane structures are autophagosomes which take in part of the cell material and organelles the outer membranes of the autophagosomes fuse with the vacuole membrane and their contents are gathered into the vacuole the contents taken into the vacuole are degraded by the degradative enzymes when i observed yeasts that had been starved for several hours i found that large numbers of small granules accumulated inside the vacuoles and that they were highly mobile the granules were single membrane bound structures which contain a portion of cytoplasmic materials the granules were drawn into the vacuoles and presented the appearance of brownian movement the brownian movement occurred because yeasts contain so small amount of proteins and are low in viscosity this made a great impression on me and i spent hours watching them ohsumi said this was the first time anyone had actually seen the working of the autophagous function of vacuoles when the degradative enzymes in the vacuoles are present and working normally in a yeast cell any cellular material collected in the vacuole is immediately degraded hence no one had ever seen this before these days light microscopes provide x magnification but in those days the maximum was x professor ohsumi laughed and said i m lucky i might not have noticed them if they hadn t been moving ohsumi then went on quietly all my research findings started from observations with a microscope so even now i always get the students who come to my laboratory to work with a microscope in one sense this should be the way biology is done and i believe that phenomena themselves are important i want my students to naturally confirm things with their own eyes and hopefully make new discoveries with their own eyes too do the things you find truly interesting after his success in witnessing autophagy with a microscope professor ohsumi began work on identifying the genes connected with autophagy autophagy genes are now known as atg genes a total of atg genes have been discovered in professor ohsumi transferred to the national institute for basic biology in okazaki aichi prefecture which has the necessary staff and equipment to elucidate the functions of the proteins that are encoded by the atg genes several years later with the assistance of research workers at the institute professor ohsumi was able to show autophagy to be one of the most basic functions of the cells of many plants and animals in recognition of this string of successes he was awarded the fujihara award the japan academy prize and the asahi prize between and he also received the kyoto prize for basic sciences in finally professor ohsumi offered this message to the next generation today s young people approve of research in the service of humanity while maintaining a steady and conservative outlook that calls for research on humans rather than on yeasts or mice however you can answer the most basic and important questions about the nature of life through yeasts my research was able to explain autophagy precisely because i was working on yeasts and could observe them under an electron microscope basically it s not easy to define what will serve humanity nuclear power is a good example so my message to all of you who want to pursue a career in science is to do what no one else is doing and do what you find truly interesting research isn t easy however if you re really drawn to a subject and you re interested in it you ll certainly overcome all the obstacles even if say your work isn t appreciated for a time you only live once others aren t interested in trivia in the end you have to want to taste the pleasures of success after all is said and done autophagy can be seen in every single organism from plants to human beings it is one of the most basic functions of cells it has become clear that it is not simply a response to starvation but also contributes to a variety of physiological functions inhibiting cancer cells inhibiting aging eliminating pathogens and cleaning the insides of cells yoshinori ohsumi molecular cell biologist learn more about honorary professor yoshinori ohsumi and his prize winning

is dark matter actually a black hole looking to modern cosmology to unravel the mysteries of the universe on september the american gravitational wave observatory ligo observed gravitational waves for the first time in history the penetrability of gravitational waves should make it possible to observe the universe immediately after its birth professor teruaki suyama of the department of physics school of science specializes in modern cosmology and is conducting theoretical research based on gravitational waves to unravel the fundamental mysteries of the universe such as the nature of black holes that formed in the early universe and of dark matter which is believed to make up the majority of the universe gravitational waves a shocking discovery what did you think when ligo succeeded in directly observing gravitational waves and what impact does this have on space research i had heard about the first observation and was looking forward to the press conference in washington d c the first thing dr david reitze executive director of ligo said at the press conference was we have detected gravitational waves i was very excited gravitational waves are phenomena in which time and space distortions i e space time distortions caused by the motion of massive celestial objects propagate like waves at the speed of light it was predicted by einstein s general theory of relativity and had been indirectly confirmed but had not been directly observed i have been doing theoretical research on gravitational waves since my graduate school days gravitational waves are so weak that if two objects were meter apart they would only vibrate about meters or about th of the size of a proton so i thought there was no way to capture such waves and that it would be almost impossible to observe them in my lifetime therefore i was shocked when i learned that they had actually been found cosmologists have tried to see the early universe by observing light coming from its oldest days until now cosmic microwave background radiation which is observed nearly isotropically from all directions in the universe has been the light best suited for seeing the early universe however because the temperature was too high immediately after the birth of the universe for light to travel straight ahead that light cannot reach us today and cannot be observed but since gravitational waves have high penetrability they can be a powerful cosmic observation tool and reach us even if they were emitted just after the birth of the universe although we have not yet found gravitational waves emitted immediately after the birth of the universe more than gravitational waves have already been observed since ligo s observations we believe that further development of gravitational wave observation technology will enable us to observe gravitational waves from the early universe and further unravel its mysteries density fluctuation in the early universe courtesy of naoj physics based modern cosmology how was the universe born how did it grow and what will happen to it in the future tell us about recent modern cosmology modern cosmology is a physics based field that studies the history and formation of the universe the origin and formation of the universe have been of great interest to people since ancient times observing the movement of the stars and galaxies was the main means of observation but there were also myths such as the earth being supported by four elephants who were standing on the shell of a turtle the idea that the universe is eternal has been dominant since ancient times but in the s a theory was proposed that the universe began with a big bang that occurred long ago the idea is that more distant galaxies are observed to be moving away faster and the universe is continuing to expand theoretically the general theory of relativity proved that the entire universe is expanding and the validity of the big bang theory was accepted subsequent studies have estimated that the big bang occurred billion years ago so how did the stars and galaxies in the nascent universe form this is explained by the inflation theory proposed by professor emeritus katsuhiko sato at the university of tokyo and other researchers in the idea is that the universe expanded rapidly from a high temperature high density energy state in the short period of seconds immediately after its birth as scientists observed various places in the universe they found that strangely enough the structure is all the same the reason for this can be traced to the theory that the universe originated from a single place of the same origin and expanded rapidly in this case if we apply quantum mechanics even in the immediate post birth state space is always fluctuating creating an uneven energy density it is thought that in areas of high density gravity attracts more and more material from the surrounding area and in areas of low density the density becomes increasingly lower thus increasing the density gradient this is how stars and galaxies were formed modern cosmology has progressed rapidly in recent decades with more and more revelations from observations of gravitational waves along with theoretical developments new questions are being raised in rapid succession there is also much about inflation theory that has yet to be clarified in addition matter such as stars and galaxies comprise only of the total universe and the rest is referred to as dark matter and dark energy the true nature of which has yet to be revealed i believe that the search for their true nature is an extremely important challenge that is not limited to the quest to understand the universe but involves a wide range of fields breakdown of matter in the universe was it primordial black holes that emitted gravitational waves please tell us about the research that you are working on i am researching primordial black holes and dark matter we found that the gravitational waves observed by ligo were those emitted when two black holes formed a binary star and merged however the origin of these black holes is not known both have masses and times greater than the sun and i am investigating the possibility that they are primordial black holes since black holes with masses dozens of times greater than the sun were thought to be few and far between in the universe image of black hole merger that gave rise to gravitational waves courtesy caltech mit ligo laboratory unlike black holes formed by the collapse of stars primordial black holes are thought to have formed shortly after the birth of the universe in other words they are thought to have been created by gravitational contraction in a region of particularly high energy density theoretically we know that such a black hole could exist but no conclusive evidence of its existence has been found so far despite various methods of exploration if its existence is confirmed it should further our understanding of inflation theory differences in the formation of black holes and primordial black holes before the first observation of gravitational waves scientists said that even if a star were to become a black hole at the end of its lifetime it would not become a heavy black hole with a mass about times that of the sun however after receiving the observation results and recalculating it was found that it is in fact possible therefore it has not been settled whether the black hole observed by ligo is a primordial black hole or a black hole of a star at the end of its life gravitational waves bring us closer to the true nature of dark matter i have heard that primordial black holes are one of the candidates for dark matter that is correct dark matter is a substance in the universe that exists in large quantities but cannot be seen so its true nature is unknown scientists consider unknown elementary particles and primordial black holes a possibility if the black hole found in the gravitational wave observations was a primordial black hole the issue would be whether it could explain dark matter since the total mass of dark matter in the universe is known from measurements of the strength of gravity exerted by dark matter we compared it to black holes found in gravitational wave observations to verify the possibility that massive primordial black holes are dark matter what we found was that such massive primordial black holes account for only of dark matter and are not a major component of dark matter this is because if there were many more primordial black holes than this mergers would occur more frequently than seen in gravitational wave observations on the other hand the possibility remains that light primordial black holes of to grams are dark matter for this reason there is currently a great deal of research being conducted to determine whether light primordial black holes are a major component of dark matter can we learn what dark matter is from gravitational wave observations the fact that the observation of gravitational waves revealed for the first time that dark matter is not a black hole of a stellar mass such as the sun reaffirmed for me the power and potential of gravitational wave observations therefore we are currently working to reveal the true nature of dark matter using gravitational waves dark matter is also present in large quantities in the milky way galaxy but it is not known how dark matter is distributed within it if dark matter is not a primordial black hole then it is an unknown elementary particle in this case the mass of the elementary particle is the crucial point to a certain extent dark matter can fly if it is light so it should be distributed evenly throughout space conversely if it is heavy it should be distributed as several clumps therefore we believe that if we can determine the distribution of dark matter in the milky way galaxy we will be able to understand the properties of the matter that makes up the dark matter and i believe that gravitational waves can be used to determine how dark matter is distributed specifically when a gravitational wave arrives from far away if the distribution of dark matter is uneven the gravity created by the dark matter will cause the wavefront of the gravitational wave to fluctuate slightly this phenomenon is called the gravitational lensing effect by observing the fluctuating gravitational waves we can learn the distribution of dark matter gravitational lensing effect unfortunately at the current level of observation it is not possible to observe the gravitational lensing effect of dark matter we need a more sensitive next generation gravitational wave detector the gravitational wave detectors in operation are second generation and the united states and europe are developing third generation gravitational wave detectors the project is expected to be completed in to years this will also allow us to observe the gravitational lensing effects of dark matter europe and china also plan to launch gravitational wave detectors into space the reason is that ground based gravitational wave detectors target gravitational waves between hz and hz and observing gravitational waves at frequencies lower than hz is difficult due to ground vibrations therefore we are trying to observe gravitational waves at frequencies as low as mhz in space where there are no ground vibrations low frequency gravitational waves are extremely important in astrophysics because when massive black holes merge into binary stars they emit low frequency gravitational waves please tell us about your future goals currently my research focuses on theoretical studies of the gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves in fact i have recently begun working with ligo researchers to study waveforms associated with the gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves using actual observational data my goal for the next years is to detect the gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves while also collaborating with researchers in data analysis by doing so i hope to unravel the true nature of dark matter inspired by the theory of relativity which enables us to approach the truth of all natural phenomena he entered the field of physics how did you become a researcher in modern cosmology i chose physics at university because of a book i read on the theory of relativity when i was in high school both special and general relativity belong to simple theories but the fact that we can approach the truth of all natural phenomena from these simple theories is what makes physics so amazing then i began researching modern cosmology in graduate school i think that the appeal of basic cosmology research lies in its ability to arouse people s intellectual curiosity and inspire them to explore the mysteries of the universe what do you value as a researcher i am mindful of what my advisor told me when i was in graduate school that was find a research topic for which there is no prior research if there is prior research simply improving some of it will be an achievement but that does not make you a pioneer in that field of research therefore although it carries risks i value finding and investigating research topics on my own that have little prior research research on the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves is an example of just that in closing do you have a message for students who want to become researchers to do research you have to think for yourself and pave your own way conversely however the greatest attraction and real pleasure is the freedom to do what you want to do i hope that many young people will get to experience that real pleasure teruaki s uyama professor department of physics school of

making cancer cells glow creating raman probes for more precise cancer diagnosis according to current estimates one in two people develops cancer one method of treating cancer is to surgically remove the cancerous tissue but it is difficult to see cancer with the naked eye to address this challenge professor mako kamiya of the department of life science and technology school of life science and technology is working on a fluorescent probe that makes cancer glow she is also a leading researcher in raman probes technology which is expected to dramatically increase the types of cancer cells that can be identified kamiya aims to help realize more precise cancer diagnoses and elucidate the mysteries of life processes and pathologies fluorescent probe that makes cancer cells glow first of all what kind of research do you do the three major standard treatment modalities for cancer are surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy surgery is the removal of cancerous tissue surgery is believed to increase survival rates by removing as much of the residual cancerous lesion as possible therefore not long ago cancerous tissue and surrounding tissue were removed in large amounts however because of the adverse effects of removing normal tissue and the burden on the patient methods to selectively remove cancerous tissue continue to be sought after however it is not easy to remove only cancerous tissue although the location and size of the cancer is examined before surgery during surgery it is difficult to detect with the naked eye where and how much cancer is present this led to the development of intraoperative fluorescence imaging the aim of which is to allow visualization of cancer cells during surgery by making them glow in other words a fluorescent substance is used to illuminate the site of a cancer or other lesion this is expected to enable efficient surgical removal of cancerous tissue and eliminate omissions there is a global effort to develop fluorescent probes substances that make cancer cells glow there are two types of fluorescent probes that make cancer glow those that glow all the time and those that glow only when they react with molecules characteristic of cancer cells the latter is referred to as the activatable type we are focusing our research and development efforts on the activatable type because it has the advantage that even the smallest cancer lesions can be detected immediately research on probes at kamiya lab is conducted as follows first design the molecular structure of the probe according to an objective next a compound is synthesized based on the design purify to extract only the desired compound from the synthesized product in addition nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry ms are used for compound characterization then evaluate whether it has the desired characteristics by spectral analysis finally it is applied and administered to cancer cells or cancer model mice for imaging and confirmation this cycle is repeated many times to obtain fluorescent probes with the desired characteristics what are the characteristics of the fluorescent probes that you are developing we have focused on the enzymes of cancer cells and have been working on the research and development of fluorescent probes that glow only when they react with those enzymes before it reacts with a cancer enzyme it does not glow even when exposed to light but its special feature is that once it reacts with a cancer enzyme it instantly glows brightly allowing it to rapidly illuminate the cancer this project has been carried out in collaboration with prof yasuteru urano of the graduate school of pharmaceutical sciences at the university of tokyo and many lab members when i first saw with the naked eye how the cancer in a mouse model of cancer glowed i was convinced this would become a great innovation what difficulties have you faced in researching fluorescent probes since different types of cancer have different enzymes it was difficult to find the optimal fluorescent probe first we increased the types of fluorescent probes and searched among these probes for one that glows from cancer in doing so we were assisted by clinicians from a variety of medical departments we were delighted when as a result of our search we found a promising fluorescent probe and were able to illuminate cancers in patient derived specimens fluorescence microscope installed in kamiya lab kamiya states that unlike conventional fluorescence microscopes these microscopes are wonderful because they do not require a darkroom when a fluorescent probe is set on a cell that has been made to allow cancer cells to glow the cancer cell can be observed glowing raman probe for simultaneous observation of multiple molecules in a cell what research are you focusing on now since around in addition to fluorescent probes we have begun development of an activatable raman probe that can be used in raman imaging raman imaging is an attempt to observe raman signals originating from molecular vibrations using light by detecting raman scattering one of the interactions between light and molecules we can identify the type of molecule and analyze its molecular structure there are so many different types of molecules in the cell that interact with each other and function together therefore a comprehensive understanding of life processes and etiologies requires simultaneous observation of more types of molecules and clarification of their interactions fluorescence imaging has the problem of being limited to four or five types of molecules that can be detected simultaneously while raman imaging has the advantage of being able to detect more than types of molecules simultaneously surpassing fluorescence imaging raman probe a generic term for chemical probes used in raman imaging by using raman probes with different molecular vibration frequencies multiple molecules can be detected simultaneously compared to fluorescence imaging raman imaging has the advantage of being able to detect more types of molecules simultaneously i see the importance of being able to see multiple types of molecules the type and combination of enzymes that each type of cancer has differ therefore we believe that if we can observe more patterns of enzyme activity by using raman probes that detect multiple enzyme activities we will for example be able to make more precise diagnoses it may also become possible to propose effective treatments according to the character of the cancer such as a certain drug for a certain pattern of enzyme activity kamiya purifying compounds that can be used as fluorescent probes or raman probes successfully developed the world s first activatable raman probe what challenges does raman imaging present a major challenge for raman imaging has been the limited repertoire of activatable probes that glow only when they react with specific enzymes and other molecules in the cell raman signals are derived from molecular vibrations thus it was thought that it would be difficult to control the raman signal intensity however one thing led me to think that perhaps we could develop an activatable raman probe that would turn on the raman signal only when it reacted with the enzyme of a cancer cell and so i decided to begin researching that professor yasuyuki ozeki of the university of tokyo s research center for advanced science and technology heard my research presentation at a workshop i attended in the summer of and approached me according to prof ozeki there is a paper that is currently being discussed in the field of raman imaging and the structure of the compound in the paper is very similar to the structure of the fluorescent probe i developed i began collaborating with prof ozeki on the possibility of applying my fluorescent probe design to raman imaging to create an activatable raman probe then in we successfully developed the first activatable raman probe it was a challenge with no precedents and it was a continuous process of trial and error but thanks to the efforts of our lab s assistant professor hiroyoshi fujioka we were able to really move this project forward in in collaboration with prof yasuyuki ozeki of the university of tokyo s research center for advanced science and technology kamiya succeeded in developing an activatable raman probe depicted here is enzyme activity in two lung cancers a and h using four different raman probes ggt lap dpp and gal thus hopefully having more types of enzymes and activity patterns that can be observed simultaneously will enable more precise cancer diagnosis what factors made development of the probe possible concept image of raman imaging which glows in various colors in response to enzymes in cancer cells i still think it is a matter of constantly being on the lookout to break new ground especially with regard to the activatable raman probe i feel that my efforts to collect information by actively participating in research groups and presenting my results have paid off please tell us about your future goals i would like to put the diagnostic and imaging methods using the newly developed fluorescent probes and raman probes into practical use in clinical and research settings i would be very happy if i could create something that biologists and physicians truly believe in and if this could lead to the elucidation of the mysteries of life processes and etiologies studying is the process of reading a textbook and research is the process of creating a textbook how did you become a probe researcher i enrolled at the university of tokyo and in my second year of undergraduate school i had to choose a faculty while visiting various faculties i was attracted to and ended up choosing the faculty of pharmaceutical sciences which encompasses multiple fields such as biology chemistry and physics furthermore in my fourth year of undergraduate school i was assigned to a laboratory i chose professor tetsuo nagano s lab working on fluorescent probes in the laboratory of chemistry and biology graduate school of pharmaceutical sciences the university of tokyo the reason i chose it was because when i went to visit the laboratory i was impressed by the atmosphere and the fact that it is a domain that integrates biology and chemistry in the laboratory under the supervision of prof nagano and prof urano and surrounded by great senior colleagues junior colleagues and friends i had a wonderful research experience the fun of research on probes lies first and foremost in the thrill of creating entirely new compounds with your own hands and if the synthesis is successful one of the pleasures is to be able to observe its shiny glow it was also a moving moment for me to see cancer cells that were invisible to the naked eye i found myself turning into a researcher what are your most important beliefs as a researcher research can never be done alone i always try to remember that i have many different people assisting me i also want to create things that are not just self satisfying but that can actually be used in the real world by actively listening to the user s point of view and the needs of society to this end i value dialogue with those around me in closing do you have a message for students who want to become researchers i always tell students that studying is the process of reading a textbook while research is the process of creating a textbook research is the process of revealing something previously unknown through experimentation and observation research is a continuous process of things going wrong and other difficulties however the moment you discover something new or something that goes the way you want it to is a very rewarding moment nevertheless it is hard to imagine what goes on in a research setting today many universities including tokyo tech hold open campus events so if there is research that interests you i encourage you to take advantage of these opportunities to visit laboratories and talk directly with the researchers mako

impact of microplastics on ecosystems pursuing co prosperity through the unity of human and nature microplastics adversely impact the environment and ecosystems raising concerns on how they affect aquatic life assistant professor cheng shuo department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society has created a simulated ecosystem called a microcosmic system to investigate how aquatic organisms are impacted by microplastics hazardous substances on the surfaces of microplastics pose more of a problem than microplastics themselves tell us about your research i am researching the impact of environmental contaminants such as microplastics on the natural environment ecosystems and humans microplastics are microscopic plastic particles with a diameter of millimeters or less microplastics are generated when discarded plastic products gradually become finer due to phenomena such as weathering the term was first proposed in the s and then defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in in actuality many microplastics in the natural environment have sizes ranging from micrometers m to nanometers m these microplastics cannot be seen with the naked eye while researching plastics i learned that plastics that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye are relatively easy to collect conversely plastics that have already become finer are difficult to collect and are widely dispersed in the environment via water and wind i also learned that microplastics have a larger specific surface area surface area per unit mass or unit volume than plastics before being reduced to a fine size this means that hazardous substances such as heavy metals and dioxins tend to adhere to the surface of microplastics unbeknownst to us microplastics have existed all around us as carriers of hazardous substances there have even been reports of microplastics being detected in human blood in fact it is believed that the hazardous substances on the surfaces of microplastics are more harmful than the microplastics themselves therefore i decided to investigate how microplastics impact the ecosystem microplastics dispersed by wind and water have an adverse effect on aquatic life impact of microplastics mps on aquatic ecosystems using microcosmic systems to simulate ecosystems tell us in detail about your research theme since microplastics exist widely throughout the natural environment my research targets the entire ecosystem or food chain however real ecosystems have an extreme level of complexity which makes it difficult to collect and analyze data also if i were to conduct experiments using environmental contaminants or hazardous substances in an actual ecosystem my experiments and research itself would cause environmental destruction to solve this problem i adopted microcosmic systems controlled experimental ecosystems a microcosmic system is a simulated ecosystem that can be controlled by selecting several representative animals plants and microorganisms from the ecosystem i am currently installing multiple microcosms in our laboratory and collecting data for analyzing the impact of microplastics on ecosystems moving forward i plan to analyze the collected data in detail a microcosmic system controlled experimental ecosystem imitates an ecosystem that can be controlled in shuo s laboratory multiple microcosmic systems are installed the microcosmic systems contain microalgae such as chlorella which is the starting point of the food chain plankton such as daphnia which are the primary consumers of microalgae and zebrafish which are the consumers of plankton secondary consumers the systems also contain bacteria and fungi that break down organic matter and hazardous substances ammonia nitrite etc contained in food residues carcasses etc into small molecule organic matter and non toxic nitrogen gas that can be reused by producers what methods do you use to collect data for example chlorella widely inhabits lakes and rivers chlorella is a microalgae with a diameter of to micrometers it is the starting point of the food chain and serves as a food for plankton and small fish therefore firstly in order to investigate how chlorella is impacted by microplastics i culture chlorella by itself i then observe changes in the chlorella s rate of growth and its contents of proteins sugars vitamins etc in fact i found that when the amount of hazardous substances attached to microplastics increases the ability of chlorella to produce nutrients decreases resulting in a decrease in the production of protein and sugar in addition to chlorella i also confirmed an impact on plankton such as daphnia which are the primary consumers of chlorella a microcosmic system for aquatic organisms depending on the water tank researchers change the amount of microplastics with hazardous substances attached to the surface researchers found that the higher the amount of microplastics introduced in a tank the lower the production capacity of chlorella nutrients if the amount and quality of nutrients contained in microalgae such as chlorella decreases it is natural for plankton to stop eating chlorella furthermore fish such as zebrafish that eat plankton secondary consumers of chlorella will also be adversely impacted in this way a negative impact on the entire food chain was confirmed through experiments and collected data daphnia white dots the primary consumers of chlorella ate less chlorella when the quality and nutrients of the chlorella declined additionally all organisms come into direct contact with microplastics so there are concerns regarding both direct impact and indirect impact on the food chain to examine this further researchers placed microplastics with hazardous substances such as heavy metals and dioxins attached to their surfaces in a tank and observed zebrafish for about one month as a result they also learned about the impact of hazardous substances on fish and fish eggs for example adult zebrafish enter a state of antioxidant stress due to microplastics and hazardous substances adhered to the microplastics researchers observed phenomena such as a decrease in the hatching rate of juvenile fish and an increase in the malformation rate of successfully hatched juvenile fish hazardous substances adhering to microplastics destroy clam dna what were your main findings it is conceivable that hazardous substances adhering to the surface of microplastics might simply pass through organisms bodies and be excreted together with the microplastics unfortunately through our research we confirmed that this is not true instead we confirmed that hazardous substances actually entered a clam s body and destroyed the clam s dna this was our most significant result of the year we clarified that the hazardous substances attached to the microplastics have a greater negative impact than the microplastics themselves what difficulties have you encountered in your research originally i had been studying automatic control of machines and other equipment at north china electric power university beijing afterwards i came to japan in to conduct research on solid waste treatment and energy conversion at the interdisciplinary graduate school of science and engineering name at that time tokyo institute of technology however since my field of expertise is not life science i had to study life science concepts and methods from scratch before starting this research furthermore when constructing a microcosmic system it is necessary to raise a variety of aquatic organisms yourself from microalgae to bacteria plankton and small fish such as zebrafish i had never even grown a plant by myself before so this was a big challenge nevertheless the challenge has made me more interested in aquatic life moreover breeding aquatic life has helped me understand the laws of nature initially i never imagined that i would need such a wide range of knowledge about aquatic life in order to build a microcosmic system our laboratory raises various organisms such as algae bacteria paramecium daphnia aquatic plants shrimp and fish tell us about your future goals i want to complete my research by expanding the investigation and analysis of the impact of microplastics from the molecular level to the entire natural environment we need to assess the impact of the elusive and pervasive threat of microplastics and take action as soon as possible i am confident that this research topic will be of great meaning for our future shuo has clarified that hazardous substances adhering to microplastics destroy dna and have an impact on organisms at the molecular level she is currently studying the adverse impact of microplastics at each level from molecules to cells tissues and individuals moving forward she plans to expand the scope of her research to include the entire natural environment pursuing co prosperity through the philosophy unity of human and nature what prompted you to start researching microplastics what are your thoughts on environmental issues my hobby is scuba diving so i was shocked to see television reports on sea creatures such as turtles with discarded plastic wrapped around their bodies that s why i started researching microplastics in china there is a philosophy of unity of human and nature that crosses the three religions of confucianism buddhism and taoism this is the idea that humans and nature are inherently united in this philosophy nature refers to natural environment since the industrial revolution the rapid development of economies and society has disrupted the balance with nature and humankind has caused environmental destruction therefore we are now starting to make serious efforts to stop global warming however since humans have become accustomed to a lifestyle of convenience it would be difficult to return to a pre industrial lifestyle economic and scientific progress cannot be stopped a deeper understanding of nature is essential for humans to achieve co existence and co prosperity with nature however we still lack a sufficient understanding of nature personally i believe that we must strive to better understand the natural environment and life other than humans as a student why did you choose to study abroad at tokyo tech i have an unusually strong sense of curiosity and i decided to study abroad because i wanted to see the world outside of china i chose japan as my study abroad destination because i had visited japan through my father s work when i was in the fifth grade of elementary school my father was a doctor and had exchanges with japanese hospitals i fell in love with japan during my visit and i always thought that japan would be a good place to study abroad fortunately i had the opportunity to fulfill my dream so i enrolled at tokyo tech in and received my ph d in after that i spent about two years doing my postdoctoral fellowship at tsinghua university in china i then returned to tokyo tech as a faculty member in before enrolling at tokyo tech i was having trouble deciding on my future career path however upon entering tokyo tech i found my lifelong research theme and made up my mind to live as a researcher i am very grateful to tokyo tech what message do you have for students who want to become researchers i have two pieces of advice first to become a researcher imagination observation and action are more important than test scores alone the second is to have a firm understanding of what you really want to do be honest with yourself about your feelings and persevere until you have accomplished your goals life is a long stretch of decades talented individuals are especially prone to encountering various temptations during their journey and straying from their chosen path however i believe that persevering and seeing things through to the end is the most important quality as a researcher cheng s huo assistant professor department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society school of environment and society creating

creating artificial cells and molecular robots using dna exploring the boundary between matter and life our bodies are equipped with amazing biological systems such as immunity and metabolism these systems recognize our surrounding conditions process information and operate autonomously but despite these systems being composed entirely of known substances we have yet to be able to artificially create living systems where is the boundary between matter and life professor masahiro takinoue department of computer science school of computing is working to solve this mystery from the perspectives of both physics and life sciences professor takinoue is engaged in research using artificially synthesized dna to create artificial cells and molecular robots that function autonomously artificial cells capable of autonomously processing and storing information tell us about your research i d be happy to to start with an example the human body has a function called immunity immunity maintains our health cells engage in a series of behaviors which consist of detecting the intrusion of an enemy such as a virus or bacteria identifying the intruder as an enemy and then pursuing and attacking the intruder when viewed from the perspective of physics and engineering this behavior is akin to an autonomous robot that combines information processing and motor functions moreover the energy to drive this cellular behavior is obtained from sources such as the surrounding blood the cells operate using an extremely low amount of energy all of these cells are composed of substances that can be obtained by researchers if we were able to artificially manufacture such cellular behavior it would be useful for the prevention and treatment of diseases furthermore autonomous robots have a wide range of applications for example in addition to being useful for exploration in the human body they can explore the deep sea outer space and other areas which are difficult for humans to access therefore our laboratory is conducting research on artificial cells and molecular robots researchers in various countries around the world are also conducting research on artificial cells however a major distinguishing feature of our laboratory is that we use artificially synthesized dna as a material my specialty is physics and information science not biology consequently i am most interested in how to combine substances to build complex autonomous systems like cells therefore my research theme is to artificially create different types of living systems and connect them to engineering applications while also pursuing the operating principles of living systems how do you make artificial cells and molecular robots using dna there are two main reasons that we use dna the first is the ability to incorporate dynamic information processing and the second is the ability to create a three dimensional structure in accordance with design through self assembly self assembly means that atoms and molecules gather to form a naturally stable structure similar to how water molecules gather to form a snowflake the first important point is that dna has four types of bases adenine a thymine t guanine g and cytosine c base pairs formed by a t and g c create a double helix structure of dna and store genetic information in other words the foremost feature of dna is that information can be incorporated into the molecule by specifying the base sequence this feature cannot be found in other substances such as plastic using properties like this we can create a molecular computer by skillfully designing base sequences we can perform computations and store information by installing molecular computers in artificial cells or molecular robots we can give them autonomy originally this field was pioneered by professor leonard adleman of the university of southern california about years ago however the pursuit of how to process information with molecules is still an important research theme for molecular computers we will build completely new calculation methods that do not exist in conventional computers the second point is that by designing the base sequence of dna we can freely create various three dimensional structures other than the double helix structure professor nadrian seeman of new york university invented a technique for creating arbitrary two dimensional or three dimensional nanometer sized structures nano is on the scale of we can use electronic computers to predict what kind of base sequence can be used to create a certain three dimensional structure simply by mixing the dna with the designed base sequences in a solution and incubating it for a certain period of time the dna will self assemble and create the desired three dimensional structure our laboratory is located within the school of computing which mainly conducts research on electronic computers however we possess research facilities for not only electronic computers but also biophysical wet experiments i believe that such an interdisciplinary environment will create new science fields mix the dna in solution left above and place it in a dedicated device for a certain period of time right below the desired three dimensional structure is achieved through self assembly an artificial cell by accumulation of dna origami tell us in detail about your research themes i am currently conducting research on two main themes the first is research on cell sized molecular robots shaped like capsules our goal here is to create cell like molecular robots from dna and proteins with specific functions such as exterminating viruses and cancer cells multiple molecular robots would then exchange information and operate in cooperation like an immune system in order for molecular robots to cooperate with each other it is necessary to equip the membranes that compose the capsule with an information exchange function therefore we make the membrane from dna by making the membrane function as an interface with its surroundings we enable the capsule to move autonomously in response to external stimuli in addition the human body s immune system stores information about enemies such as viruses by using dna in the membrane we also equip the molecular robot with the ability to store information my second research theme is to produce artificial cells using microchannels the maximum size of a molecular robot that can be manufactured through self assembly is nanometers this is about of the thickness of hair we need different techniques to make larger molecular robots and artificial cells therefore our laboratory has used microchannels we can manipulate dna by flowing a solution containing dna through the microchannel by using this process we can create larger molecular robots and artificial cells external view of a microchannel left above a microchannel is a plate in which micrometer wide fine channels and wells right below are formed in a thin substrate made of transparent silicone rubber and glass by flowing a solution containing dna through the microchannel we can produce molecular robots and artificial cells of a large size what are your main findings so far in we discovered a phenomenon in which dna gel behaves like a liquid in certain conditions and in which separate dna gels fuse together and change shape until now dna gels were thought to maintain a constant shape so it was a huge surprise when we saw the gel in liquid form moreover we also found that simply changing a few base sequences of the dna significantly changes its properties the information of only a few bases controlled the properties of a gel with a cell size times larger than the bases we are currently developing this technology into computational dna droplets that detect micrornas mirnas which are biomarkers for cancer novel method for early disease detection using dna droplets tokyo tech news published june by designing the base sequences of dna it is possible to prevent dna gels from fusing together in the image dna gels of like colors fuse together green to green blue to blue but dna gels of different colors do not this was achieved by changing just a few base sequences another major result recently made by our laboratory was the creation of artificial cells by a membrane like structure made of a large accumulation of dna origami i was thrilled when i used a fluorescence microscope to confirm that dna origami accumulated and made capsules by self assembly the dna origami has a structure with a pore in the center so the surface of the capsule also has multiple pores we are now able to achieve a communication function by releasing a substance from the pore and exchanging the substance between capsules dna origami has a hexagonal shape in which dna is folded by self assembly we create capsules by having them overlap by themselves through the process of self assembly the diameter of the dna origami is nanometers and the diameter of the capsule is micrometers concept image of artificial cell microcapsules formed using dna origami ishikawa et al angew chem int ed the fundamental differences between matter and life what led you to starting your research when i was in high school i read an article in a scientific magazine about conway s game of life which was devised by professor john horton conway of princeton university the article gave me the desire to study artificial life conway s game of life is a simulation that imitates the process of life for example birth evolution and selection ever since i was a kid i had wondered what it meant to be alive when i learned about conway s game of life i was excited at the potential for grasping the essence of living things through mathematics and physics on the other hand ever since i was in junior high school i had a vague desire to become a researcher at the same time i was fascinated by albert einstein s theory of relativity and enjoyed physics at the time i was wondering how to balance both of my interests then upon entering university i learned that there was a field of biophysics where i could study both biological systems and physics i knew that this was my calling in life i decided to enter the department of physics and study biological systems from the perspectives of physics and information science however although the concept of conway s game of life is extremely interesting i was worried that it had no material substance consequently i began to feel the desire to create artificial cells using actual molecules then upon entering graduate school i learned that the laboratory run by my supervisor professor akira suyama professor emeritus at the university of tokyo was researching molecular computers using dna and i decided on molecular computers as the theme of my doctoral dissertation tell us about your future goals my short term goal is to enable artificial cells and molecular robots to perform complex information processing using molecular computers my long term goal is to link artificial cells and molecular robots to each other thereby achieving systems that can perform important functions similar to the immune system my ultimate goal is to examine the fundamental theme of differences between matter and life since biological systems are actually composed of non living matter our own bodies have demonstrated that living systems can be created using non living matter however the reason why we have not been able to artificially create living systems is that doing so requires understanding physical and chemical design principles of living systems that we humans do not yet know the ultimate purpose of my research is to seek out the design principles which are something that i find very interesting the research that we conduct can be quite challenging and we often face completely unexpected results from our experiments the basis of our research is not only to create artificial cells and molecular robots but also to investigate the mathematics and physics of the biological systems behind them therefore when we encounter a physical or chemical phenomenon that differs from our imagination asking the question why is always a new starting point for research the thrill of being a researcher is to encounter the unknown what message do you have for students who want to become researchers for me the real thrill of being a researcher is the moment when i encounter something that is unknown to anyone else in the world my advice for young people who aspire to become scientists is to devote their interests to any subject that attracts them research is not only fun it is also difficult therefore i advise young people to pursue their true interests without being overwhelmed by the opinions of others and the trends of the times devoting yourself to the pursuit of your interests will open up new paths which you never expected molecular robot an artificial molecular system that integrates molecular devices sensors computers actuators etc designed using molecules by receiving external molecular signals and making decisions through molecular computing molecular robots possess the senses intelligence and movements for reacting autonomously to the environment dna dna is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid dna possesses advanced molecular recognition ability based on the sequence information of four types of bases a t g and c and is responsible for the storage and transmission of genetic information in a living organism in recent years the chemical synthesis of dna has become easier by using its molecular recognition ability dna can be used to record complex nanostructures e g dna origami and digital data it is also applied to technology such as dna computers that are capable of solving mathematical problems dna origami two dimensional or three dimensional dna nanostructures composed of a long single stranded dna approximately bases and many short single stranded dna several dozen bases by folding a long single stranded dna into a single stroke according to our desired shape and fixing it with short single stranded dna designed to complement each other a structure that is several dozens of nanometers in size can be created reported in by dr paul rothemund of the california institute of

understanding ourselves through our interactions with computers from booking train tickets to keeping in touch with our loved ones people are constantly communicating through shaping and being influenced by computers understanding and improving this two way relationship or interaction is the core of the field of human computer interaction current technologies often seek to reproduce human human relationships with computers but our high expectations social biases and imperfect understanding of ourselves limit the design of these technologies and the success of the experiences that they provide katie seaborn associate professor in the department of industrial engineering and economics and head of the lab for aspirational computing at tokyo tech actt recognizes these issues better than most her groundbreaking research is helping to resolve these issues forcing people to critically evaluate their contributions to technology and helping to envision a more positive inclusive and socially responsible future seaborn joined tokyo tech in april here we introduce her fascinating research and discuss the future of technology advancing knowledge with human computer interaction what kind of research do you do my research is in a field called interaction design now interaction design involves a combination of other areas of research and industry like computer science and industrial engineering and even the arts psychology and anthropology my specialization is in human computer interaction i look at the relationship between people and the variety of computer based systems products and services that they use at the core of this field is the human factor the social psychological cognitive and physical attributes of people that influence or are influenced by interaction with things in the world in my case computer based things while computers may change for example we now focus more on smartphones than on desktop computers the human factor remains when designing technologies creators tend to rely on human models even subconsciously for some replicating humanity in machines is the dream but there is also a danger that we must contend with we may not understand ourselves well enough to recreate humanity in machines beyond stereotyped and superficial ways alexa and siri are cases in point they both represent the current standard of virtual young women assistants replicating a human model of traditional gender roles where women are cast as servile helpers in society there is a considerable age bias in technology as well you don t get to see aged avatars in virtual assistants or hear aged voices these biases are well established what we need to do and what i m trying to do is work on solutions this is the hard part that needs much creativity and academic nourishment only now are we recognizing the need for social justice within technology and research spaces at a large enough scale to take action and be taken seriously by the global research community human factors engineering exploring the human factor in interfaces interactions and experiences serious games gamification applying playful strategies and crafting games for serious pursuits inclusive design critical computing designing to support diversity from age to disability and beyond research themes of the lab for aspirational computing at tokyo tech actt a lot of my research has focused on achieving attitude and behavior change through strategies like gamification and gameful design i ve tended to focus on evaluating the effects and contributions of playful experiences on the lives of specific user groups like older adults or people with disabilities i think something that really highlights how our perceptions on social justice and bias have changed is that older adults were a niche group when i started working with them a decade ago now our rapidly ageing societies have pushed the older adult user to the forefront of research overall it is an exciting time to enact change create cool stuff and contribute to human knowledge all at once an intergenerational shared action game system created by seaborn and her team and reported on in her paper entitled intergenerational shared action games for promoting empathy between japanese youth and elders published in the proceedings of the th international conference on affective computing and intelligent interaction acii how would people respond to an aged voice assistant tell us a little about voice based systems voice based systems cover a number of products devices and environments from smart speakers and digital assistants like siri to the voices of robots or even websites we re starting to take up these technologies more and more so we need to figure out how to design them to meet our needs and expectations as well as understand how they influence our attitudes and behavior at the moment i m looking at virtual assistants right now they are kind of boring and gimmicky most of the tasks they can complete they don t need to do there tends to be a strong initial interest that quickly tapers out it s not just a matter of bugs and technology problems it s also a matter of meaningful use or the lack thereof in this case i feel that s kind of a shame so my work is focused on the future of virtual assistants what could the design and capabilities of the ideal voice assistant be in her recent literature survey for the acm association for computing machinery seaborn provides a high level classification framework of voice based human agent interaction vhai from voice in human agent interaction a survey published in acm computing surveys vol no there s also a critical social aspect to voice assistants that we can t ignore voice as an expressive medium conveys an array of meaningful characteristics like age gender and personality which are called psychosocial characteristics it also conveys what s called sociolinguistic characteristics which refer to rhythm dialect and style of speech these characteristics are deeply tied to human perception psychology and cognition within human human communication but voice is still an emerging factor in the design of machines so consensus on how to evaluate and explore voice based technologies is still in progress people also react differently to voice technologies when they come out of a computer speaker or smartphone as compared to a human like robot we need to not only classify these differences and pinpoint where they come from but also explore our biases and preconceptions when interacting with these voice based technologies a lot of research has been published in the last few years about the gender bias in voice based agents and interfaces as i mentioned there s an age bias as well other forms of bias are starting to be recognized including based in racial and ethnic codes accents and social class a couple of years ago i worked on a project that used storytelling to prevent cognitive decline in older adults the voice we used was that of a year old man and naturally that influenced how our listeners interacted with the program but what was the nature and extent of the influence this is something that i m keen to explore i recently received a grant for research on virtual assistants that have the voice of older adults i want to study how people of all ages but especially older adults respond to an aged computer voice and what they expect out of such an assistant will human models of bias against older adults play a role what might longitudinal interactions with the technology tell us about ourselves could bias against older adults be disrupted or shifted through positive meaningful and regular interactions with such a system we re only just starting to ask such research questions in this area of study the boundaries between humans and technology are fluid speaking of the social aspects of technology you recently proposed a brand new threshold for artificial intelligence that achieves sociality can you explain the concept behind it this work was inspired by a simple question what is and is not artificial intelligence ai traditional ai focused on algorithms to perform actions or produce outputs but now the idea of embodied ai is taking hold embodied ai basically means that the ai is interacting with some world usually the physical world but also virtual worlds and learning from these interactions to continually improve its functioning nowadays these embodied ai like voice assistants and robots are increasingly being used to carry out tasks for and support decision making in people this is a social activity of communication between one agent and another in this case the embodied ai and a person when the person perceives and reacts to the embodied ai as if it is a social agent then it becomes socially embodied it s crossed the threshold at least temporarily that was the idea what we call the tepper line when a machine crosses the tepper line it is seen as social but it can just as easily be punted back if its interactions fail to be socially convincing to the user whether or not a machine is perceived as social depends on the person interacting with it and this perception may not hold up over time as the interaction plays out from moment to moment or over several interactions the embodied ai may make mistakes that reveal its artificiality suddenly it loses that social quality but it can recover people are predisposed to perceiving sociality in interactive agents even non human ones this is why i named the line after sheri s tepper an award winning science fiction author who explored how boundaries between humans and non humans including alien species and technology are constructed and fluid the tepper line can also apply to the diversity of ai based technologies out there important questions are being lost in the momentum behind gamification you also mentioned that you work in games and play could you tell us more about that one field of study that i ve worked within is called gamification and it basically describes the intentional use of game elements to create a gameful experience in non game tasks and contexts a common example is when an app provides points and badges for tasks that can be treated as achievements game elements are mostly inspired by modern computer games and video games so there are many many near universal elements like points and leaderboards but there are sometimes roleplaying elements too like when you choose a character class and have levels where you progress researchers have been looking at individual differences in people who play games and use gamified platforms people have different interpretations interests and motivations when it comes to gamification these can be based on previous experience with games age personality there are a wide variety of factors involved one of the things i m concerned about is the removal of gamification questions were raised early on about the effects of gamification will positive effects last could negative effects materialize as time passes but nearly ten years on there s still no answer we already have many gamification elements in things we use in daily life like say the educational system where you do have achievements move up levels and so on but much of the research is focused on the addition of gamification elements what we need to find out is what happens when we take gamification away what happens when we ungamify maybe different people will react differently to gamification or its removal but how what factors into these reactions i d love to get my fellow researchers interested in this and put together a panel or workshop on the subject because there is such a dearth of research as a recent small literature survey of mine showed years ago now myself and other researchers expressed some concern about whether gamification does no harm it may just be that there is so much momentum behind gamification right now that we are still focusing on the most obvious research questions and not the deeper impact i m developing my own independent tracks your work touches upon a wide range of topics what inspires you to work on such diverse subjects much of my research so far has been driven by the people i ve had the privilege of working with throughout my research career as well as the academic resources we ve had at our disposal i also read a lot and widely from general science magazines to science fiction many sci fi authors look at the deeper human questions of technology which helps me think of things from a different perspective i m now working on developing my own independent tracks in response to the latest topics and technologies in human computer interaction thinking beyond the interface what got you started on your research journey i started working as an amateur web developer in my teens when the internet was still new and computers weren t commonly found in the home but towards the end of the s people started to see that the web might be the future i started making websites as a creative endeavour then my parents friends started to ask me to build them websites for their businesses ultimately it was these experience that led to my career in human computer interaction during my undergraduate degree i worked for the government of canada and in private sector where i was creating the interfaces that people would interact with when they used a website or app when we tested our products with people i found myself thinking beyond the interface what was the larger impact of our technology on people and societies how could we find out this led me back to graduate studies that was when i had my first opportunity to do research and i really loved it i then moved across canada to toronto and started a ph d at the university of toronto there is a special school called the knowledge media design institute kmdi a really multidisciplinary space where i was able to work with a lot of different people who had different skills and perspectives this inspired all of us to think about technology differently after my ph d i held a few postdoctoral research positions in the uk and japan including at university college london interaction centre uclic the university of tokyo and riken center for advanced intelligence project aip when i finished my postdoc tenure i joined tokyo tech as an associate professor and started my own lab seaborn develops the mixed reality game for her doctoral research with the support of profs deb fels and peter pennefather her mentors circa the university of toronto toronto canada tokyo tech has the human factor why did you choose tokyo tech what drew me to tokyo tech was the industrial engineering department which offered a program in human factors engineering as well as complementary programs focusing on computer systems typically when you find human computer interaction at universities it s a small subset of a larger department maybe one or two courses or in a specific lab i was very excited to find a specialization at tokyo tech i knew i would have access to top class technical ability and the opportunity to share my multidisciplinary background the perfect combination for my field of study another reason why i moved to japan was because of its super ageing society since japan also continues to be a world recognized leader in technology it made sense to come here at the same time japan has little diversity and representation which is a massive problem socially as well as for research and design yet tokyo tech wanted to hire me an english speaking western woman and visible foreigner of a certain age as a research leader and educator in its engineering school in tokyo tech i see a place where new forms of leadership and innovation can emerge i hope that my lab will contribute to this vision people need to evaluate how they embed their beliefs into ai speaking of the human factor how do you predict our interactions with machines will change in the future right now there is a shift from the traditional idea of interaction as merely input output facilitated by computers towards a more comprehensive and critical perspective that recognizes people embed their own values beliefs and socially constructed understandings of the world into machines we may be able to understand ourselves and our limitations better if we critically reflect on the technologies we create and how we interact with them a personal hope i have for the future is for non sentient ai to become smart enough to take over the psychologically difficult and harmful tasks that humans must currently do for instance people have to manually curate social media content to find and remove hate speech violent content and illicit materials at the same time we must be careful to be consciously and conscientiously in the loop when it comes to the progression of these ai we re shaping these ai and deciding what constitutes illicit and what doesn t if we don t recognize this we are ultimately doing more harm than good already we have social media algorithms hiding content with ugly people breast feeding mothers indigenous peoples and people of color and queer people for no clear or consistent reason i can only hope that i can help shape a society that we can all be happy living in by pursuing lifelong learning and striving for integrity in the work that i do research is my ikigai finally what advice do you have for students aspiring to work with you or in your field research sometimes proceeds slowly bit by bit with unpredictable setbacks i m someone who can t stop thinking about research and coming up with new ideas to explore regardless of any setbacks or a slow pace it s my ikigai a japanese concept that refers to the things that give your life meaning and purpose although this might just be my severely limited western interpretation of the term but i believe in seeking out that meaning and purpose i want to contribute to knowledge i m not satisfied with superficial conclusions or the absence of an answer i want to know and know deeply if you feel this way then the research life may be for you i love to work with people who think differently and are open to change including changing your own mind people who are not content with the status quo and have a vision of how to change it people who have a range of skills and perspectives and are willing to develop technical abilities as well ultimately you need to have vision drive technical skill and a desire to make waves at tokyo tech if you are in the fourth year of your undergraduate degree you can join a lab to experience research in your department which will give you the opportunity to understand what it means to be in a lab and do research making it as a researcher requires bravery determination creativity and skill as well as a good dose of luck and favorable circumstances but as my friend and mentor peter pennefather professor emeritus of the university of toronto says if you re someone who just can t help themselves when it comes to research you ll succeed katie s eaborn associate professor department of industrial engineering and economics school of engineering school of engineering creating new industries and advancing civilization

exosomes and their role in how cancer spreads exosomes are tiny particles released by all cells ayuko hoshino an associate professor at the school of life science and technology was the first to discover that exosomes are involved in determining which organs certain cancers metastasize to the research is gaining much attention with the hope that it will lead to revolutionary diagnostic methods and treatments for cancer and other diseases after spending eight and a half years training at weill cornell medicine hoshino joined the school of life science and technology as an associate professor in march here we introduce her extraordinary research journey survival rate drops once cancer spreads to other organs first tell us about your research i am researching how cancer metastasizes there are many types of cancer including breast lung and pancreatic cancers cancers that develop in each of these organs are called primary cancers as the primary cancer grows it can enter blood and lymph vessels and metastasize to other organs becoming metastatic cancer for example in breast cancer while it is in the primary cancer stage the survival rate after years is or higher but once it metastasizes survival rate drops to around once a cancer metastasizes it becomes much more difficult to treat it s actually not easy for cancer cells to metastasize blood flows through vessels at a tremendous speed and even if cancer cells get close to the organ to which they metastasize it is not easy for them to remain there pass through the narrow gaps between cells and then spread to other organs moreover it has been known for more than years that the organs to which a cancer metastasizes are strangely limited depending on the type of cancer for example breast cancer tends to metastasize to the brain lungs liver and bones while metastasis by osteosarcoma a type of bone cancer is often limited to the lungs and pancreatic cancer tends to metastasize to the liver however the mechanism behind this tendency of cancer to metastasize to certain sites remained a mystery for many years i found that exosomes are deeply involved in cancer metastasis and now i m studying their mechanism exosomes are tiny particles about to nanometers billionths of a meter in diameter that are released by all cells they are only about the size of a virus exosomes have traditionally been considered as garbage bags that remove unwanted substances from inside cells but in recent years it s been found that exosomes released from one cell can be taken up by other cells and that exosomes act as a communication tool between cells electron micrograph of exosomes only about the size of a virus these tiny particles are released by all cells exosomes use postal codes how are exosomes involved in cancer metastasis cancer cells and the organs to which they metastasize have a relationship like seed and soil if you try to plant corn in different parts of the world it will not grow in all soils it s believed that exosomes play a role in cultivating an organ the soil such that cancer cells the seed can grow in it i am working to understand this mechanism therefore we injected exosomes released by various types of cancer cells into the blood circulation of mice we confirmed that exosomes released by cancer cells that metastasize to the lungs went to the lungs and exosomes released by cancer cells that metastasize to the liver went to the liver we also performed a proteomics analysis to verify the protein cargo differences between exosomes that localizes to different organs in we discovered that each exosome produced by cancer cells has something like a postal code in regards to metastasis the postal code was a protein called integrin integrins are proteins involved in cell to cell adhesion regardless of the type of cancer it became clear that exosomes released by cancer cells that metastasize to the lungs have an integrin named and the exosomes released by cancer cells that metastasize to the liver have an integrin named v conversely when these integrins were removed from the exosomes the cancers did not metastasize to those organs it turned out that there is a strong relationship between the organ to which these cancers metastasize and the expression pattern of the integrins we published these findings in nature in exosomes reach the future site of metastasis before cancer cells and change cells at the site making it easier for cancer cells to metastasize my ultimate goal is to help create new diagnostic and therapeutic methods based on exosomes what are your future research goals the interesting thing about exosomes is that they are released from every cell and are involved in the various cellular changes that occur in the body even if two diseases that are related to the same organ seem completely different in regard to etiology such as cancer cells that metastasize to the brain and autism spectrum disorder we can infer that they may share a common mechanism for example we are realizing that both exosomes easily reach the brain and influence the brain environments therefore since early on i ve been interested in doing research on exosomes in different types of diseases which focus on the same organs when it comes to other diseases analysis of exosomes targeting the same organ will eventually reveal how the exosomes are involved in disease progression if a common mechanism can be identified it could be revolutionary for diagnostic treatment and therapeutic methods of diseases by collecting blood and analyzing the exosomes that are present early detection and treatment of various diseases including cancer would be possible for example the likelihood of metastasis could be reduced before a cancer spreads my ultimate goal as a researcher is to help create new diagnostic and therapeutic methods based on exosomes through proteomics analysis of exosomes in blood we can identify not only the presence of cancer but also the type of cancer axes values denote relative difference in composition with points further away from the origin indicating greater difference a strong desire to help people can inspire research why did you choose a career in cancer research i love the periodic table so i chose applied chemistry as my major at university but while i was in college a friend of mine was hospitalized with osteosarcoma when i went to the hospital to see my friend there were many children with pediatric cancer i was shocked when i found out that many of the children pass away within three years from that moment i became determined to study cancer to help save children s lives after graduating from university i continued on to the graduate school of frontier science department of integrated bioscience at the university of tokyo in my first year of graduate school in i was shocked by what i learned at a guest lecture by dr david lyden from weill cornell medicine who later became my mentor the destination for metastasis of cancer cells was predetermined and the location was already cultivated so that cancer cells could easily metastasize therefore i felt that if we could understand what initiates this mechanism and develop treatment methods based on it then that might save people s lives i was filled with hope why did you decide to study at cornell university after the lecture i went to ask dr lyden what criteria do you consider for postdocs then he asked me when will you finish graduate school i answered in four years i still clearly remember him smiling and saying that s a long way off that same day i sent dr lyden an email and he replied after that we continued to exchange emails over the new year s holidays this led to me studying abroad in gaining a be prepared attitude is there a difference between american and japanese research environments at american universities things like race gender position and research goals are all included and accepted as diversity i have a year old daughter who was born in the united states and the maternity leave there was very short it was only weeks in my case since children can t be taken to the lab they set up a lactation room for me people even shared various post maternity advice like how watching videos on your phone of your baby crying can help with pumping breastmilk when i tell this to people in japan they are surprised so i think japan may also need a cultural shift so that going through life events like having a baby should be something that is easily accommodating also what was very helpful while i was at cornell was my gaining a be prepared attitude i learned to always be prepared so that i don t miss an opportunity in the united states there is something called elevator talk training this is a career development training for honing your skills on how to highlight your abilities and seize opportunities in the tens of seconds you have when you are in an elevator with a researcher you admire elevator talk is also useful for presentations at academic conferences when prof hoshino began working abroad dr david lyden s lab had less than people only three of them including hoshino were studying exosomes since then more people have begun focusing on exosomes dr lyden s lab now has more than members all of whom are studying exosomes is there a way of thinking that has helped you in your career as a researcher ultimately you can only do what you can do so just do your best every day the greatest fear of a researcher is that one day another researcher will suddenly publish a paper on a topic that you ve been working hard on this is unavoidable because there are many researchers around the world working on the same topics i think the only way to handle this is to try as hard as you can each day to convince yourself that you did your best and just couldn t make it in time and the only way to do that is to devote yourself to your research each and every day in my case rather than thinking i want to be a researcher i was motivated by the thought that the only way to help these people is to become a researcher the road to my final goal is still long but i definitely hope to reach it but regardless research is fun especially at moments when i realize that i am the only person in the world who knows about this phenomenon i am observing this is something indescribable and i truly feel happy to be a researcher i hope that more young people will be able to experience this feeling i would like to build on my experiences in the united states to create a lab in japan at tokyo tech where we can compete with the rest of the world ayuko h oshino associate professor department of life science and technology school of life science and technology

protecting lives from floods by advancing rainfall prediction and combining disaster prevention with conservation the effects of climate change associated with global warming are diverse and one of the most severe is flooding in fact in fall two super typhoons faxai and hagibis hit japan in succession causing devastation across the country we asked two emerging researchers in flood mitigation about new approaches to reducing damage from floods assistant professor rie seto of the school of environment and society department of civil and environmental engineering conducts cloud research for improving accuracy of precipitation forecasts assistant professor rei itsukushima of the school s department of transdisciplinary science and engineering studies flood control measures based on awareness of historical flood control systems and microtopography microtopography terrain variations on the scale of to features smaller than what topological maps can clearly show interview held on march current challenges posed by major flooding rie seto in recent years there has been a surge in major floods in japan and elsewhere what current challenges do major floods pose seto infrastructural measures have been taken to reduce flood damage such as building dams to store rainwater and levees to prevent flooding and they have been beneficial but in recent years typhoons and heavy rains have become more frequent and existing dams and levees are no longer able to prevent flood damage furthermore constructing new dams and levees can be enormously expensive and time consuming and in any case no suitable locations in the city are left to build them so it s not a practical solution on the other hand i do not believe that existing dams are being fully utilized especially for multipurpose dams used as both a water source and for flood control it would be very effective if the water volume could be adjusted in advance for example by discharging accumulated water before a typhoon or heavy rain this could reduce the likelihood of flooding in downstream rivers when typhoon hagibis made landfall in october the yamba dam under construction on a tone river tributary was in the experimental storage stage so it was almost empty the flooding of tone river was prevented partly thanks to accumulation of rainwater there which revealed the possibility of more effective use of existing dams the biggest reason that flood control in dams has not been fully utilized lies in the inaccuracy of typhoon and heavy rain forecasts in order to release water from dams in advance it is necessary to accurately predict when where and how much rainfall will occur if water is released in advance but rainfall is less than expected it will have a significant effect on water use and power generation in particular it is important to predict the location of the rainfall the amount of water stored in the dam varies greatly depending on whether rain falls within or outside of the river basin despite that the main focus has been on predicting amount of rainfall without much progress in pinpointing predicted location of rainfall therefore i am focusing on ways to improve the accuracy of rainfall location prediction flood risk greatly depends on whether rain falls outside left or over right the river basin rie seto s research focuses on ways to improve accuracy of rainfall location prediction itsukushima as seto sensei mentioned japan has been preparing for flood damage since the meiji era mainly by constructing dams and continuous levees as a result the frequency of floods and the extent of inundations during flooding have steadily decreased compared to the past lowlands that are more likely to be flooded when rivers overflow are called floodplains thanks to dams and levees we are now able to live in places like floodplains which were previously uninhabitable due to frequent floods but that s not entirely positive this is because the risk is larger for unexpectedly major flooding in addition as the number of people affected by floods decreases the sense of impending crisis due to floods also diminishes with fewer people in a vicinity being affected by flooding experience with flooding does not get passed down rei itsukushima in recent years major floods have been frequent with incidents such as the heavy rains in kanto and tohoku the heavy rains in northern kyushu and typhoon hagibis in existing dams and levees have become unable to cope nevertheless even if dams and levees are built to handle major floods with an occurrence probability of once every or years even more floods than that will occur in the future as seto sensei mentioned building new dams and levees alone is not enough the aim of my research is to reduce damage on floodplains when they become inundated by rivers in particular i focus on flood control measures based on an awareness of historical flood control systems and microtopography in the days when technology for building levees or dams at major rivers did not exist people lived where floods were less harmful they devised ways to mitigate flood damage by controlling flow and momentum these structures and systems have disappeared as modern control measures have reduced flood damage and advanced land use my research involves reconsidering historical flood control systems and combining them with modern control measures from the meiji era onward to reduce major flood damage in floodplains i believe that these measures will not only reduce flood damage but also restore and preserve the natural environment a river that has seen little human influence left and one heavily influenced right rei itsukushima is studying ways to mitigate flood damage through environmental restoration and preservation cloud data is a plus for weather forecasting prof seto tell us more about your research seto to improve accuracy of rainfall location prediction i observe cloud water content using satellites thereby improving the accuracy of computer simulations cloud water content is the amount of water contained in clouds part of the critical data on which weather forecasts are based is atmospheric field atmospheric field includes wind speed temperature and pressure atmospheric motion occurs in response to instability of the atmospheric conditions causing cloud formation and rain numerical models called weather models are used for weather forecasts conventional weather models focus on replicating atmospheric conditions and rainfall without focusing on the clouds between them that s why so little is known about how accurately the models represent the water content of the clouds also the means to measure them accurately have been limited conventional weather models have focused on atmospheric conditions and rainfall rie seto focuses on accurately determining the water content of clouds which links the former two concepts why is it difficult to measure cloud water volume seto if you look up at the sky you can see that clouds are very unevenly distributed to understand the distribution of the cloud water volume we need to measure at not only one place or one time but as widely and frequently as possible therefore satellite based methods are suited to monitoring cloud water content the most widely used method is satellite based passive microwave observation where microwaves emitted from clouds and picked up by satellites can be used to estimate moisture content however it is not easy to estimate this with satellites since clouds have cloud droplets raindrops ice and snow of various sizes all mixed in and distributed in a complex manner in addition there are significant barriers to observing cloud water volume especially over land microwaves are also emitted from the ground surface below the clouds sea is somewhat uniform but land has forests and cities as well as rivers the temperature and moisture content of the ground surface are not uniform so microwave radiation from the land disturbs signals from clouds in order to monitor the cloud water content over land with high accuracy we need a good understanding of the conditions of the land this requires some skill and is not easy measuring land and clouds at the same time is a particular focus of my research for short term weather forecasts of several hours to several days the accuracy of forecasts varies greatly depending on the initial values given to the weather model my approach is to try to predict rainfall location accurately by inputting satellite observation data for cloud water content into the initial values at present our predicted rainfall locations closely match actual locations with accurate rainfall location prediction we are aiming to extend the lead time of forecasts and improve overall accuracy forecasts using observations of cloud water volume lower left actual rainfall conditions top center without cloud information top right with cloud information seto s method correctly forecasted unpredicted rainfall lower center conventional model predicted heavy rain at the wrong location lower right seto s method predicted heavy rain at the correct location measures to prevent floods from causing flood damage prof itsukushima tell us more about your research itsukushima to begin with the terms flooding kouzui and flood damage suigai are often confused flooding is a natural phenomenon in which water overflows from rivers due to heavy rain and the damage caused by flooding is flood damage the important point is that floods do not result in flood damage modern flood control measures since the meiji era have reduced the frequency of floodplain flooding drastically changing land use the flood control systems built on floodplains are disappearing so in some areas the damage potential from major flood damage is even increasing i use historical topographic maps aerial photographs and literature to investigate the disappearance of flood control structures and land use changes flood control topographic classification map showing the properties and conditions such as ground height and soil quality of the terrain distributed in the plain it reveals the elevation of the land and the conditions of past floods orange indicates a high altitude plateau yellow indicates a slightly higher natural levee created by the rise of sediment carried by rivers onto riverbanks light blue indicates a floodplain submerged by flooding green indicates a back marsh where puddles are prone to forming and blue indicates a former river bed where a river used to flow comparison of maps showing land use at a station between and this reveals that in the urban area was concentrated on plateaus and floodplains and back marshes where floods were likely to occur were generally uninhabited wastelands and rice fields but in all terrains including floodplains and back marshes showed development underway created based on the geospatial information authority of japan s flood control topographic classification map open levee kasumitei a traditional flood control system source national institute of land and infrastructure management at present most of the levees are continuous mainly in urban areas but old levees were discontinuous levees to provide local defenses with intentional openings in addition many discontinuous levees for controlling floods have been set up both along rivers and on floodplains a typical one is called an open levee kasumitei the right is upstream and the left is downstream when the water level of the river rises due to flooding water flows backward from the opening of the open levee furthermore when the water level falls the overflowing water returns from the opening eliminating inundation from flooding this reduces the amount of water going downstream thus reducing flood damage open levee kasumitei a traditional flood control system source national institute of land and infrastructure management to prevent the water from overflowing at all the river width must be widened and in narrow areas such as mountainous areas cultivated land is narrowed accordingly open levees on the other hand not only protect the downstream from flood damage but also cope with flooding without narrowing the cultivated land most levees at present are continuous levees but open levees remain at the kuji river in ibaraki prefecture the area i am studying in addition in order to quantify how discontinuous levees such as open levees function in the event of major flood damage inundations in the present with continuous levees and in the past with many discontinuous levees have been reproduced by computer simulation this has revealed that with continuous levees the flood area is small but once flooding occurs there is no place for the flood water to return to the river creating places where flood water can easily collect locally in the past however when discontinuous levees were set up the flood area was large but the inundation spots were dispersed and it was confirmed that the flood water level and flow velocity were low the old flood control structures are filled with the wisdom of our ancestors the past is truly a guide to the present itsukushima indeed based on the results of these studies it would be possible to reduce major flood damage on floodplains by combining historical flood control systems with the river infrastructure currently in place such as levees and dams in addition i think that flood control measures that tolerate flooding can solve both environmental and flood challenges in japan there are many organisms that have adapted to the flooding environment many of them are now in danger of extinction as the frequency of floodplain flooding has decreased catfish and crucian carp entered the back marshes and old river beds used as paddy fields from rivers during floods and laid eggs there if as is the case today the floodplains and rivers are completely separated by continuous levees the habitats of these rivers will decrease and the creatures will become fewer therefore in terms of maintaining nature and ecosystems it makes sense to utilize the old river beds and back marshes as a storage space for flood waters and to take flood control measures that tolerate inundation the floodplain ecosystem disappeared because of the disruption of continuity between floodplain and river due to river modifications farmland consolidation and residential development opportunity to start the research what first motivated you to pursue this research seto from a young age i loved looking up at the sky and clouds and couldn t resist looking things up when i had questions about natural phenomena so i had a vague idea that i wanted to be a researcher in natural phenomena at one point i was interested in astronomy and physics but i also had a strong desire to help society in addressing environmental issues i chose to go into the field of social infrastructure at university and my current research satisfies my desire to get involved with both nature and society itsukushima i was born in a suburb of funabashi city chiba prefecture where a relatively large amount of nature remained when i was a child wetlands and rivers called yachi were my playground but while i was in elementary school these places were gradually lost due to railway construction and residential development as i grew up it made me feel lonely how the natural world where i had played as a child was disappearing i became interested in environmental issues and the field concerned with rivers which were my playground at university i learned about river environment conservation after completing graduate school i joined the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism and worked on tasks related to flood damage that has led to my current research on flood control measures on floodplains disaster and environment related issues often cannot be solved within rivers and the river basin must be targeted i became a researcher because i wanted to consider river issues from a broader perspective thinking about what we can do what advice would you give others on measures to take in the event of possible flood damage seto first of all it is important to think about all possible dangers to yourself this can only be done in normal times so we should get started right away specifically it is a good idea to look at a hazard map to see how much current risk there is for flooding where you live i live near the tama river so during typhoon hagibis last year i checked a hazard map to see if there was a possibility that my place would be flooded there wasn t so i didn t need to panic if you learn from a hazard map that you live in a high risk area it is important to evacuate as soon as possible but as for landslides the hazardous areas on hazard maps are extensive and you do not know when or where one will occur so you will have to make difficult decisions but any way you look at it the first step in preparing for disasters is to find out what kind of area you live in another important thing is to track the forecasts and warning information from the meteorological agency in a timely manner the accuracy of forecasts has been significantly improved in recent years although the accuracy at small scales such as the location of rainfall is still lacking as mentioned earlier rather than relying on your own experience to determine whether you re in the clear strictly complying with forecasted alerts and warnings can help you to protect yourself itsukushima i also think it is very important to be interested in the area where you live above all for example place names supposedly reflect the history of past disasters so it may be helpful to look into the history of the area where you live to help you develop countermeasures i live near the gotanda river which pours into the tama river the gotanda river is a typical urban river covered with concrete however the other day i was overjoyed to find a kingfisher at the river i would like people to be at least a little interested in the natural environment of the rivers where they live for example by watching birds or fish r ie seto assistant professor department of civil and environmental engineering school of

what does diversity really mean a talk with associate professor asa ito asa ito is the director of the future of humanity research center a center in the institute of innovative research focusing on how perceptions of the human body are influenced by disabilities looking at her past experiences and current research we talked with her about what diversity really means it all started with my love for insects these creatures so much tinier than humans without warm blood and without brains they must live in a world completely different from mine i want to see the world that they see until my second year in university i carried those childhood thoughts with me as i entered into science wanting to become a biologist what first gave me the idea to become a biologist was a book i read in junior high school the time of an elephant the time of a mouse biology of sizes translated by tokyo tech professor emeritus tatsuo motokawa the book explains how sense of time differs between species affirming my idea that different creatures do live in different worlds the time of an elephant the time of a mouse biology of sizes by tatsuo motokawa however when i entered university i became disillusioned with how science was so finely segmented into specific disciplines what i wanted to understand were more comprehensive macroscopic concepts such as how do different organisms perceive the world they live in we too are living in different worlds in my third year i switched from science to liberal arts i chose aesthetics which focuses on vague and verbally indescribable areas such as feelings evoked by artworks through aesthetics my interest shifted from inter species differences to those of the human body even though we are all of the same human species our physicalities completely differ that made me realize that we too are living in different worlds i am bound by my sight i began wanting to free myself from that restriction so i decided to talk with visually impaired people from those i spoke with i learned how they can estimate the size of a room or how crowded it is by the echoes of voices that showed me that there are other ways of seeing the world aside from vision i also spoke with people with stutters dementia people who had lost part of their body function due to cancer or accidents and others i learned about the different ways of perceiving and using the body to perceive the world translating judo moves into towel language in my latest research project carried out jointly with ntt laboratories we aim to make sports experiences available to visually impaired spectators usually visually impaired spectators enjoy sports by listening to live broadcasts but those i spoke with shared negative experiences saying that they could not feel the thrill of live events or the sense of unity with other spectators so looking for a way to cover what live broadcasts can t i came upon sense of touch and vibration our first attempt was to use a towel to translate judo why a towel because we thought a sheet of cloth could do something similar to how a tether held by a blind runner and sighted guide can allow them to synchronize their movements it may look like a mere rope but it can transfer tremendous information during running for example if a hill appears ahead the guide will see it and react thinking oh there s a hill that reaction gets transferred through the rope to the blind runner who will also then react thinking oh there s a hill fleeting emotions that arise just before verbalization are conveyed directly this involuntary communication differing from what we do in everyday life happens via a rope we decided to use this theory to express the sensations of judo in the process a blind spectator holds the center of a towel which is held at both sides by two judo athletes as the athletes move the struggle and tactics of their movements get conveyed to the spectator just watching is becoming obsolete we then realized how non disabled spectators also enjoy games in a limited way only by watching is this really the right way to appreciate sports even athletes don t always depend on their vision for example think of soccer players the better they become the less they see the ball when dribbling in other words there is a significant gap between merely watching sports and experiencing them to fill the gap we have built a site called mienai sports guide showing various sports activities in non visual ways the site currently covers ten events based on feedback from top athletes of each sport on the sensations they have during their games it shows how to translate those sensations using daily objects for example the site presents fencing and baseball as follows fencing in fencing the player holds a foil lightly between the index finger and thumb and as the foil is very flexible wrist movements play an important role in this activity the sensations of engaging blades and releasing to strike are conveyed using entangled wooden blocks shaped as a c and h with both players eyes closed one player tries to disentangle their block while the other player tries to prevent it baseball this activity conveys in a non visual way a psychological aspect of baseball how a batter reads a pitcher s movements with both players eyes closed the pitcher pulls a cord the batter tries to read the pitcher s movements by touching the pitcher s shoulder then grabs the cord if the hitter grabs the red portion it is a home run if the white part then it is a swing and miss and if the surrounding area it is a hit we tend to think that the real charm of sports is only available to top athletes or those who have mastered the skills after significant effort but how wonderful it would be if even non skilled spectators could experience the essence and sensation of individual sports even partially the result is new landscapes of sports enjoyment which continue evolving all that is the intention behind the mienai sports project and our ongoing efforts to translate the intrinsic quality of various sports based on top players feedback overuse of the term diversity my research and other experiences in my life have caused me to question what is true diversity personally i m worried about how the term diversity is getting overused i spent six months living in the us and i seldom heard the word diversity this is because diversity is the norm there and the issue lies in how to build a society based on that premise but in japan i m afraid the superficial promotion of words like diversity and inclusion result from a misunderstanding of the concepts with people saying everyone can be different the words become an acceptance that everyone can be indifferent to one another this links with insensitive use of labels such as when referring to people by nationality or to those with visual impairments as the blind this is not how it should be we must see the diversity in each individual for example someone who is blind may be a parent at home and a professor at the workplace blindness is just one of the facets constituting that person by redefining each individual with diverse aspects you will find more possible ways to interact with them their otherwise invisible personas will manifest and your respect for them will grow diversity is seeing the diversity within an individual then how can we change our way of seeing people let s think what does the phrase disabled people remind you of ideas such as consideration support and assistance of course those things may sometimes be necessary but if that s all you imagine and nothing else then it may lead to self righteousness so the first step is to tear down such one sided relationships as an example the fencing game described in the blog i previously mentioned would allow you to really play with a visually impaired person since the game involves something beyond sight their abilities may be far better than yours that allows you to remove the handicapped label and see them as an individual accepting diversity is the tolerance of chaotic disorders talking about the japanese we are generally less resistant to chaos and tend to control human relationships with the prevailing sentiment in the air depending on the situation there are always implicit rules shared by the majority of those present dubbed reading the air this rule implicitly forces you to behave in a predetermined manner one should act this way or should say thank you in specific situations chaos is not allowed things should be orderly everything is ritualistic all this creates a society hard to live in for both non japanese who speak different languages and are from different cultures or those with developmental disorders i believe it is time we stopped reading the air and performing rituals in human relationships that doesn t mean stop considering others but caring for them without being ritualistic disabilities are just an example differences related to various factors such as race gender and religions can be invisible walls among people we should not allow that and strive to build a society where diversity or diverse aspects of each individual will be celebrated without any forced consciousness i want to pursue this goal through my current and future projects research at the future of humanity research center begins in february the future of humanity research center starts its operation we interviewed associate professor asa ito the appointed director of the center about its purpose and goals science and technology have significantly changed our lives but the development of robots and artificial intelligence starts rewriting the definition of human beings to cope with such a situation and bring out better the potential for science technology we need to prepare practical and essential questions with a focus on people in decades or centuries ahead addressing those issues toward the future is the purpose of establishing the future of humanity research center as a center for humanities and social science research located within a science and engineering university it features diverse researchers from the institute for liberal arts the first five years will concentrate on rita ism altruism which is an indispensable guidepost to navigate through today s ruthless society where exclusivism is rampant and fragmentation is accelerating here is how we refer to rita ism it comprises actions and attitudes benefitting others not ourselves this seemingly irrational stance can lead us to hints for redefining people society and science technology from fresh perspectives such perspectives are free from meritocracy utilitarianism or numerical evaluation they originate from the human quality aspect illuminated by the light of rita research fields at the center will include politics economy religion artificial intelligence environment space and others through collaborative projects and exchanges with other researchers and experts in various fields we plan to develop our rita practice in approaches unique to tokyo tech please look for our upcoming rita project at the future of humanity

industry and academia the different paths of two researchers both seeking to create the next generation of batteries the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to three scientists for developing the fundamental technologies of lithium ion batteries powering everything from smartphones and laptops to electric cars they are an indispensable component of modern society ryuichi natsui and assistant professor kota suzuki are two tokyo tech graduates from ryoji kanno s world leading laboratory on battery research both are working to bring forth the next generation of batteries but through different career paths after graduation natsui chose to work in industry and joined panasonic while suzuki chose to continue in academia at tokyo tech what were their thoughts at that time what informed their choices what kind of future do they hope to create in ryoji kanno atsuo yamada currently professor at the university of tokyo laboratory i understand that you both enrolled in the same laboratory in have you kept in touch since then ryuichi natsui panasonic corporation with our schedules not so often but we have crossed paths at special occasions like our labmates weddings kota suzuki tokyo tech we ve also run into each other at research facilities and conferences what was your research when you were at kanno lab kota suzuki tokyo tech suzuki i studied lithium batteries this year s nobel prize in chemistry went to drs goodenough whittingham and yoshino scientists who built the foundation for lithium ion batteries it is such a wonderful achievement and i am honored to be working in the same field as these pioneers as a student i focused on the interface of lithium batteries the boundary between electrode and electrolyte a lithium battery is made up of two electrodes an anode and cathode placed in an electrolytic solution ions traveling between the anode and cathode allow for charging and discharging of electricity and the interface acts as the entrance for the ions understanding the chemical reactions that occur at the interface is very important to increasing battery life however the phenomena at the interface had not yet been clarified so i made models of thin films to study them natsui i was working on a lithium battery material called cathode powder batteries deteriorate after repeated charging and there is growing demand for batteries that can be charged more rapidly addressing these issues requires that we understand the underlying mechanisms so my research was to try to understand them during those days what were your impressions of each other suzuki i felt that natsui kun was good at working efficiently in a limited amount of time and always went about his research logically natsui suzuki kun was thinner than he is now laughs and was cool looking he has an energetic side but his research style is slow and steady very methodical kun is a japanese suffix often used between friends during their student days at a lab party at graduation taking their first steps on separate paths natsui san you chose to join panasonic and suzuki san you chose to stay at tokyo tech what motivated you to choose the paths you have followed ryuichi natsui panasonic corporation natsui i wanted to be involved in monotsukuri actually making things so i felt that working in industry was the way to go the battery market is expected to continue to expand and i wanted to work in an environment with a competitive future suzuki i also thought about the private sector but in the end i realized that it s a really great thing being able to spend your days immersed in research preparing for an experiment off site or authoring a paper it s hard to put into words but i enjoy that atmosphere you get the night before a festival laughs i d also heard that no other university has the environment and facilities that tokyo tech has so i chose this path to continue to be involved in cutting edge research natsui once when i was attending a conference i saw that suzuki kun was serving as the moderator i was so impressed because the only people who sit there are those who have been acknowledged by the field suzuki conversely i think natsui kun is in a great position because he gets to be involved in the development of new products right up until launch natsui actually it s a thorny path before a new product can finally go out the door what research are you involved in now suzuki i am working on all solid state lithium batteries probably when most people think of lithium batteries they are thinking of the type that contains liquid however lithium batteries made entirely of solid materials are gaining attention as the next generation of batteries the most important part of the all solid state lithium battery is the solid electrolyte and i am trying hard to find a better one although we have good materials now they cannot be used in all places around the world the current materials we have must be stored in special containers to protect them from exposure to air which significantly increases cost if we can identify materials that are stable in air while maintaining the same performance we can reduce manufacturing costs which would lead to wider use it would be a breakthrough natsui i am involved in research and development of liquid type lithium batteries that is material development of high capacity batteries low cost high capacity and rapid charging are always wanted and light weight batteries are in growing demand for use in drones i am working to develop materials that meet these market needs suzuki in this sense i think what we re doing now is nearly equal to what we did as students isn t it though you follow different paths do you think you will ever have the chance to collaborate suzuki i don t know when but it s certainly possible natsui professor ryoji kanno s lab at tokyo tech where suzuki kun works is world class i think many companies are interested in doing joint projects with them my team handles liquid type batteries while suzuki kun s research is in solid state batteries so our paths don t really cross right now but with the progression of battery technology i think companies will be looking at what suzuki kun is doing when that time comes perhaps we will be able to work together what kind of future do you see for yourselves years from now natsui recently i find myself becoming more management oriented working in research i ve felt that there is a limit to what i can do alone panasonic has people who specialize in a wide range of fields not just batteries so i would like to be able to coordinate projects across specializations in order to find solutions i look forward to that feeling of rapid evolution when all your team members are focused on the same goal of course it s an organization so there are limitations and constant pressure to produce results however i enjoy being able to progress in my work as our strategies also develop natsui at work at panasonic suzuki for the materials i mentioned before i don t want to just find them i want to find ways to find them though it wasn t possible before we now have search methods that combine computational and information sciences as artificial intelligence continues to develop technology will help us to identify materials based on data that we supply of course this is easier said than done but i would like to explore new ways of discovering materials by combining both current and new approaches also research on the next generation of batteries after all solid state has already begun and over the next years i would like to help make these new batteries the industry standard suzuki in discussion with a student nowadays you are both active in your respective paths of industry and academia how do you think the roles of companies and universities will change in the future natsui i still want universities to be the place for finding the seeds of science universities find a seed and focus on growing it into that first flower then those of us in industry help that flower to reach full bloom that is my image of our future open innovation has been promoted for a while now but the actual number of achievements coming out of the many open innovation projects is relatively low for greater open innovation universities need to handle basic research while companies handle quality and dissemination in society suzuki i agree time and budget constraints narrow universities flexibility and prevent them from discovering seeds which then blurs the distinction between companies and universities if this situation continues then we will have no one to depend upon when we really need new ideas having a clear border between what universities do and don t do will make industry academic collaboration more fruitful what advice do you have for students who will be entering the workforce natsui i regret that i didn t have more interactions with researchers from other labs when results don t go as planned i find that overcoming that hurdle requires different ways of thinking and ideas from other fields in that meaning it is important to interact with various kinds of people i hope all students will be able to have such experiences suzuki i would like them to understand the importance of being able to make presentations and speak english i think the image some people have of researchers is a person working steadily in isolation but in reality communicating with people from different countries and different fields inspires new ideas i for example often go to international conferences and speak in front of people in english it s a good idea to take advantage of opportunities to improve your english and presentation skills

japan in pursuit of new adventures and to connect with people from all sorts of distinct backgrounds as part of the gsep program i have been able to do just that while adjusting to this unique environment was mostly smooth sailing my greatest challenge was being able to procure food as a vegetarian however i made incredible friends here who helped me learn new ways of cooking and finding more accommodating restaurants which significantly helped me overcome this struggle my interests range from programming graphic design and visual effects to blogging and reading additionally i love delving into strategic games such as chess and sudoku and more recently into music production
conformational dynamics and allostery elucidate how gpcr couple to multiple g proteins offering mechanistic insights into coupling promiscuity and novel drug discovery strategies research published august in a groundbreaking study a multinational research team led by dr adnan sljoka riken and prof akio kitao tokyo tech in collaboration with prof scott prosser university of toronto has carried out experimental and computational studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind g protein selectivity and efficacy in the human adenosine a a receptor a a r a a r is a member of major drug targets g protein coupled receptor gpcr superfamily which engages the g protein and initiates cell signaling influencing heart health inflammation cancer and brain diseases scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding how a a r can engage and activate multiple binding g proteins and the mechanisms of this selective coupling the research team discovered that the hallmark coupling promiscuity in a a r is a direct consequence of changes in activation conformations moreover the long range allosteric communication mechanisms elegantly control the sampling of specific conformers within a dynamic conformational ensemble this study offers profound insights into gpcrs selectivity and biased signaling these findings are expected to have major implications in drug discovery and pave the way for novel gpcr targeted therapeutic strategies in treating various human conditions including cancer and neurogenerative disorders this research will also enable the design of more generalized computational and ai driven studies pushing the boundaries in gpcr activation mechanisms and next generation pharmacology background gpcrs are the largest receptor class affecting almost every aspect of human physiology with of all approved drugs acting on gpcrs they regulate sensory and neuronal signaling as well as a myriad of processes associated with cell homeostasis growth and immune response gpcrs are primarily situated in the plasma membrane surrounding the cell while the drug or ligand such as hormones and neurotransmitters that acts on the gpcr binds to an extracellular pocket activation is then communicated across the receptor resulting in complexation with proteins on the cell interior since the signal arrives at the cell exterior and initiates signaling pathways within the cell this makes gpcrs particularly useful in drug discovery as the drug in many cases need not enter the cell however gpcrs activation is related to dynamic events key intermediate states and activation states that arise between the time a ligand binds and when the g protein is activated furthermore many gpcrs are promiscuous as they selectively interact with different g proteins each influencing a unique cellular response in fact g protein selectivity is one of the least understood aspects of gpcr biology capturing the conformational dynamics of gpcrs describing various functional states and understanding allosteric mechanisms and their role in g protein selectivity coupling promiscuity activation and signaling mechanisms is a formidable challenge making it difficult to predict or control gpcr behavior in drug development overview of research achievement using experimental and computational techniques including functional assays fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance f nmr mathematical rigidity theory molecular dynamics simulations and rigidity and geometry monte carlo simulations the international research team has discovered mechanism behind gpcr g protein selectivity the team focused their study on the human adenosine a a receptor a a r a a r is a prototypical gpcr distributed in the nervous system platelets immune cells lungs heart and vasculature engaging several g proteins notably g o in addition to its cognate g s protein a a r drugs have been developed to address wound healing vascular diseases including atherosclerosis restenosis and platelet activation as well as inflammation and cancer however pharmacological regimens are thought to act exclusively as antagonists or agonists to the a a r g s complex thus understanding the mechanism of g protein selectivity and efficacy in a a r and the general bias and activation mechanisms in gpcrs can yield new opportunities in pharmacology the researchers focused on studying key conformational states and dynamics of a a r by complexing it with both cognate g s and non cognate g o g proteins with same agonist ligand f nmr revealed several functional activation states of a a r when it is coupled to g s and g o g proteins when a a r engages with its preferred g s partner the receptor adapts long lived and highly populated activation states however when coupled to g o these activation conformational states are significantly less engaged and populated in fact one of the activation states was mainly observed when the receptor was engaged with g s but not g o molecular dynamics simulations and dpacs md msm calculation performed at dr kitao lab indicate that g s forms more interactions with a a r and has stronger binding affinity compared to g o additional monte carlo simulations performed by dr tucs confirmed when a a r engages g s or g o g proteins there are major changes in the receptor s dynamics which dictate the populations and interconversions between activation states identified through nmr this led to the hypothesis that allostery long range communication might be at play to probe allostery in the receptor the researchers utilized rigidity theory techniques developed by dr sljoka rigidity theory analysis validated the presence of multiple adaptive allosteric networks which were distinct when receptor engages with g s and g o the allosteric mechanisms directly control the dynamics differences and transitions between distinct functional states playing a major role in g protein selectivity and g protein receptor coupling the ability of gpcrs to connect with multiple proteins through distinct activation states could lead to better treatments highlighting the complex yet fascinating ways our body s cells communicate and respond to signals the findings in this study offer important insights into gpcrs selectivity allostery partial agonism and biased signaling with major implications in drug discovery future developments while the current study provides unprecedented mechanistic understanding of coupling and promiscuity in a a r future studies will no doubt focus on trying to generalize to other gpcrs and incorporation of advanced ai models these efforts have significant implications for designing safer and more selective therapeutics targeting gpcrs and will deepen our overall understanding of cellular signaling

building blocks for the future enantioselective cycloaddition reactions with rhodium catalysis a rhodium catalyzed cycloaddition reaction expands the possibilities for creating complex organic molecules research published august using cycloalkenes acetylenecarboxylates and terminal alkynes researchers at tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech have successfully produced chiral methylenecyclopent ene derivatives with high selectivity this reaction is an example of a catalytic intermolecular cycloaddition reaction where unsaturated compounds are combined to produce cyclic structures previously achieving products with the desired chirality with this type of reaction was challenging this breakthrough now provides valuable building blocks with broad applications including in drug discovery cycloaddition reactions are an efficient strategy for constructing cyclic compounds that are important building blocks for other chemicals in these processes electrons from different unsaturated molecules such as alkenes alkynes or dienes accommodate to form new cyclic structures in a single step electrons are those responsible for the bonds in double and triple bonds in a double bond one of the c c bonds is a bond while in a triple bond two of the c c bonds are bonds during these reactions the electrons rearrange to form new bonds resulting in the formation of ring structures for example in a cycloaddition three components each with two electrons combine to form a six membered ring in a cycloaddition two components with two electrons each along with an additional component acting as a single carbon unit combine to form a five membered ring these reactions are highly efficient because most of the reactants are converted into the final product while reactions are well established producing compounds with the desired chirality using reactions is challenging in a study published in the journal nature synthesis a research team led by professor ken tanaka from tokyo institute of technology developed a rhodium rh catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition reaction the reaction uses three different components cycloalkenes acetylenecarboxylates and terminal alkynes to produce chiral methylenecyclopent ene derivatives with exceptional selectivity the ultimate goal for intermolecular cycloaddition is the catalytic selectivity control using three different components says tanaka as a catalytic version we developed the sole example of the enantioselective intermolecular cross cycloaddition studies on the reaction mechanism showed that it begins with the coordination of cycloalkenes and acetylenedicarboxylates to the cationic rh i catalyst forming a rhodacyclopentene intermediate the terminal alkyne then reacts with this intermediate to generate a vinylidene intermediate following this a reductive elimination step produces the final cycloadduct while regenerating the rh i catalyst one of the major advantages of this method is its compatibility with a diverse range of substrates the researchers used oxabenzonorbornadiene and norbornene derivatives as cycloalkenes di tert butyl and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylates and terminal alkynes like dodecyne phenylacetylene and silylacetylenes with phosphine ligands like r binap and r segphos they could carefully control the enantioselectivity and yield achieving e isomers of methylenecyclopent ene derivatives with enantiomeric excess values ranging from to over the methylenecyclopent ene derivatives are incredibly useful building blocks for creating many different types of molecules for instance by adding hydrogen to these molecules hydrogenation the researchers produced multicyclic cyclopentenes epoxidation produced multicyclic epoxides which could be further converted into a variety of hydroperoxides alcohols and aldehydes with its vast potential to produce a diverse range of d compounds which are otherwise challenging to synthesize this catalytic approach paves the way for producing novel compounds with diverse applications the present cycloaddition and subsequent transformations provide access to otherwise inaccessible three dimensional d compounds that are attractive for drug discovery research says tanaka reference department of chemical science and engineering tokyo institute of technology japan corresponding authors emails kayaki cap mac titech ac jp yoshihito kayaki ktanaka apc titech ac jp ken tanaka school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
sustainable catalysts crystal phase controlled cobalt nanoparticles for hydrogenation researchers develop an energy efficient reusable and versatile catalytic system using abundant cobalt research published august controlling the crystal phase of cobalt nanoparticles leads to exceptional catalytic performance in hydrogenation processes report scientists from tokyo tech produced via an innovative hydrosilane assisted synthesis method these phase controlled reusable nanoparticles enable the selective hydrogenation of various compounds under mild conditions without the use of harmful gases like ammonia these efforts could lead to more sustainable and efficient catalytic processes across many industrial fields hydrogenation the chemical reaction of hydrogen gas with another compound is fundamental in industries such as food pharmaceuticals materials and petrochemicals traditionally noble metals like palladium and rhodium serve as catalysts in these reactions however these materials are scarce and expensive and their mining is plagued by environmental concerns moreover they demand highly controlled and energy intensive conditions to function effectively in recent years cobalt has emerged as a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts for hydrogenation cobalt nanoparticles co nps can catalyze hydrogenation reactions efficiently requiring lower temperatures and pressures than noble metal catalysts despite the theoretical significance of the crystal phase of co nps in their catalytic performance studying this has been challenging due to the lack of methods to produce co nps with a specific crystal phase of similar size fortunately a research team from tokyo institute of technology and osaka metropolitan university has found a solution to this issue as reported in their latest study which was published in the journal of the american chemical society they devised a new method to selectively produce co nps with two very distinct crystal phases in a convenient and consistent way we previously reported that nickel nps can be readily synthesized by the reduction of nickel complexes in the presence of hydrosilanes through a technique we dubbed the hydrosilane assisted method explains professor michikazu hara who led the study we hypothesized hydrosilanes would act not only as reducing agents for co cations but also as ligands on the metal complexes to control the growth of metal particles therefore we attempted to synthesize co nps with a controlled crystal phase via the simple addition of appropriate coordination compounds and specific diol solvents through careful testing the research team found their predictions were right and the hydrosilane assisted method could reliably produce two types of co nps depending on the reaction conditions face centered cubic fcc co nps and hexagonal close packed hcp co nps they then ran several hydrogenation experiments to explore the differences in catalytic performance between both types of co nps interestingly they observed that hcp co nps were far superior to fcc co nps in the hydrogenation of benzonitrile into benzyl amine hcp co nps achieved a much higher selectivity exhibiting a yield of compared to fcc co nps moreover hydrogenation using hcp co nps required a pressure of roughly half that of fcc co nps rendering the entire process more energy efficient this notable feat is not limited to the production of benzyl amine only as hara remarks worth noting the proposed co np based catalytic system displayed compatibility with a diverse range of nitriles and carbonyl compounds considering that cobalt is abundant and the proposed co np base catalyst is reusable and does not require harmful gases such as ammonia this work could serve as a stepping stone towards more sustainable and cost effective hydrogenation technologies in turn this will hopefully lower the price and environmental impact of many industrial commodities drugs and even food products leading to an overall better future for humanity in multiple ways reference corresponding author s email mhara msl titech ac jp subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin

out of twenty boats in the snipe race in the class yui ito and manami sasazawa finished th while rina yamada and kanna goto finished th out of boats these results mean that all eight female sailors will be going to the finals in september snipe class crew comments from yako kobayakawa pair this will be our second time in the all japan finals now that we are th year students and members of a lab we spend our time questioning and deeply examining issues likewise in sailing we aim for even greater heights by trial and error to discover the best way to sail against the forces of nature this year s competition will be the last of its kind for us so we will aim for a great result that will be the culmination of our efforts to date a warm thank you to everyone for their support kobayakawa left and yako comments from endo suzuki pair this will be our first time in the all japan women s student sailing championships just as basic knowledge is important in academics basic movements are very important in sailing we will strive to perform to the best of our ability while staying true to the basics and keeping in mind the support that we have received from so many people around us thank you for your support suzuki left and endo class crew comments from ito sasazawa pair we utilize the wind and the waves in sailing so knowledge of meteorology fluid dynamics and other fields is sometimes necessary by practicing and sharing knowledge together we were able to pass the qualifiers again this year and advance to the finals for the second time we still have a lot of work to do but we will do our best to show everyone that we have developed over the past year thank you for your continued support sasazawa left and ito comments from yamada goto pair this will be our first time competing in the all japan women s finals we have been practicing hard discussing questions together and seeking solutions to problems as they arise just as we do in our academic endeavors we will continue to conquer sailing with all our might and do our best to achieve the best possible results in the nationwide competition from the bottom of our hearts we would like to thank all those who have been supporting and cheering for us yamada front and goto sailing a sport of mind and body competitive sailing is a sport that requires a high level of strategy and tactics such as reading the constantly changing winds and tides and deciding on the best course for the boat while maintaining speed in a race participating boats start at the same time sail around buoys in the prescribed order a specific number of times and compete to cross the finish line first at the all japan women s student sailing championships sailors compete in two classes the snipe class and the class snipe class dinghies use two sails a mainsail and a jib speed can be hard to come by so sailors must utilize the wind skillfully while maneuvering strategically in relation to the other boats sailors lean over the edge of the boat to achieve balance while holding on to a belt with their feet in addition to a main sail and a jib class dinghies also use a spinnaker sail this gives the boat more speed than a snipe class dinghy but also makes balancing more difficult to prevent the boat from capsizing trapeze wires are attached to the boat allowing sailors to hang outside the vessel with their feet on the edge of the

sailing team about the sailing team the tokyo tech sailing team is a club where anyone male or female can have a role most members had never sailed before university but daily practice and drawing on past knowledge has allowed us to perform well at national championships and all japan meets a connection with the community that goes beyond club activities the ethos of the yachting club is to hone seamanship among members who love the sea growing into attractive human beings rich with the spirit of tackling challenges this ethos was born from the total support for our activities offered by the more than alumni who are members of the kuramae ushio association which forms a pillar of our current training our alumni play a large role in the club s relationships with the community such as annual contracts for training camp sites and insurance contracts being a club member means you can remain part of our community even after you stop racing what is the appeal of yachting yachting sea wind strategies and your fellows a stage no lover of the sea can resist a scale unimaginable at the high school level a mechanical depth experienced when trying out the character of the older members and atmosphere of the club and a yearning for the extraordinary everyone has their own reasons why they are drawn to yachting yachts which rely purely on the wind to move need constant balancing of the shape of the sails and boat in order to sail as fast as possible yachting can be likened to chess on the sea due to its high levels of strategy and tactics with other yachts as the winds change the battle is in both the body and mind which means that girls or other people with less exercise experience can play a role our two classes of boat we have five international class boats five international snipe class boats and two motorboats normally we train by class new members are initially taken aboard both classes so that they can choose the class and position they prefer international class a class boat these are yachts cm in overall length of the type used in the olympics they are two person boats with the sailor at the prow throwing their whole body outside the boat with a wire trapeze to balance it using the third sail the spinnaker allows it to sail even faster international snipe class a snipe class boat a two man yacht with a long history with its simple construction and difficulty in creating speed differences the key to winning is strategies that make the wind your ally and tactics taken regarding other yachts seeing sailors hiking out leaning out as far as possible to balance the boat is really impressive support boats a motor powered support boat as yachts lack engines we have two motor powered support boats to help with training and for checking safety if an accident happens the club will provide support for getting the license needed to operate these boats training camps weekend training with club members we train each saturday and sunday out by hayama members learn the skills and strength required to sail hone their ability to read the wind and also study strategies and tactics our training is led by club members based on generations of practice we also get lessons from faculty members coaches or alumni five or six times a year helping us aim for even higher levels we call this weekend training training camps we rent out a house and spend the night there together taking in turns to be responsible for cooking spending all this time together deepens the bonds between senior and junior members there is plenty of free time after training so our members can have fun together without being divided by class or year one of the best parts of the sailing team is these training camps where everyone gets along together annual schedule sailing competition with other university teams as we normally practice on weekends we are free to study work at part time jobs or even join other clubs on weekdays we practice about four days a week during the long spring break during winter the off season for sailing we go skiing the kanto intercollegiate student sailing competitions the intercollegiate where sailors compete to be allowed to enter the all japan intercollegiate sailing championships the all japan intercollegiate which is the ultimate goal of students around the country is held in spring and autumn the autumn intercollegiate is the final event for fourth year students so they train hard each day with the hope of making it to the all japan intercollegiate a proud record at the all japan intercollegiate at the autumn intercollegiate snipe class sailors earned a place at the all japan intercollegiate for the first time in years and went on to take fourth place nationwide the best result the club has ever had in the snipe class we reached st in individuals nationwide while in the class two pairs went on to the all japan intercollegiate as individuals titech sailing team s performance winning against some of the strongest schools in the country was the talk of the university yachting world and tokyo tech and our alumni celebrated together the women s student sailing championships an event for women only was canceled in but in female team members went on to the all japan intercollegiate the team took first place in the class and second in the snipe class at the tokyo regional sailing championships for national and public universities putting us top overall message for new students our future goal is to take part in the all japan intercollegiate with groups from both classes all we ask from anyone wanting to join the titech sailing team is the curiosity to start something new yachting is the perfect sport for people who want to try something new as you can draw on what you re good at we welcome anyone who wants to do something different from everyone else we re planning on an event in spring where you can try yachting out so we look forward to seeing you there club details

new toolkit makes molecular dynamics simulations more accessible research published may pacs toolkit a recently developed software package that will make it straightforward for researchers to run parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics pacs md simulations report scientists at tokyo tech this versatile software coded with python helps with the setup optimization and running of pacs md simulations in various computing environments the toolkit offers a substantial boost to research progress in drug development and molecular studies by delivering comprehensive insights into peptide folding protein domain motion and ligand dissociation molecular dynamics md simulations have become a powerful tool in the ever growing fields of molecular biology and drug development while many md simulation techniques exist parallel cascade selection md pacs md is a particularly useful one when studying the folding or conformation of proteins or the interactions between proteins and ligands the crux of this method consists of running multiple md simulations in parallel thereby exploring different possible conformations simultaneously using carefully crafted selection criteria promising conformations can be detected automatically in temporal snapshots and investigated further this strategy greatly accelerates the discovery of key molecular interactions and dynamic processes that help scientists understand protein functional motions however one of the hurdles of pacs md is that users must write custom scripts to execute their desired md simulations in these scripts they must specify the initial conditions and target features select md software to use implement a snapshot ranking procedure and prepare the initial structures for the next simulation cycle this process which can be quite complex and error prone creates a considerable entry barrier for scientists interested in using pacs md fortunately a team of researchers from the school of life science and technology at tokyo institute of technology japan recently set out to address this issue in their latest study which was published in the journal of physical chemistry b and led by professor akio kitao the team developed a software package called pacs toolkit to make pacs md more accessible and convenient to use one notable advantage of pacs toolkit is that the entire simulation process is set up via a single configuration file in this file the users specify important parameters for the simulations including the type of pacs md the number of md simulations to run in parallel and the protein residues or atoms to keep track of as selection criteria for parallel branches pacs toolkit takes this configuration file alongside standard md input files and runs pacs md simulations according to the md software specified worth noting that since the package is open software written in python a popular programming language users can help improve pacs toolkit and extend its functionalities our toolkit maintains flexibility so that new features libraries and md software can be added by introducing responsible classes in python users who can program in this language should be able to modify the code of pacs toolkit and implement new methods as needed highlights prof kitao another crucial advantage of pacs toolkit lies in its optimization and compatibility with different computing environments be it an array of supercomputers with a message passing interface mpi servers equipped with multiple graphics cards gpus or personal computers such as laptops pacs toolkit heavily incorporates parallelization using mpi gpu and the multiprocessing package of python enabling optimization of the computation time depending on the available computational resources explains prof kitao to showcase the potential of their toolkit the researchers conducted pacs md simulations tailored for three different applications these included the folding of the mini protein chignolin the motion of protein domains in a sars cov enzyme and ligand dissociation from an important adenosine receptor taken together our results indicate that pacs toolkit can be easily utilized to simulate a wide variety of dynamics for different types of molecular systems concludes prof kitao with any luck this innovative toolkit will help unlock the true potential of pacs md simulations in various fields enabling interested researchers to shed light on complex molecular processes and accelerate drug discovery reference corresponding author s email akitao bio titech ac jp school of life science and technology unravel the complex and diverse phenomena of life information on school of life science and technology inaugurated in april school of life science and technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
conformational equilibria in gpcrs provides critical clues about activation mechanisms research published march a multinational research team led by dr adnan sljoka riken prof r scott prosser univ of toronto with collaborations with dr duy phuoc tran and prof akio kitao tokyo tech and prof roger k sunahara univ of california san diego has carried out experimental and computational studies revealing key steps associated with the activation of the human adenosine a a receptor a a r a a r is a member of superfamily of receptors called g protein coupled receptors gpcrs major drug targets which engage the g protein and initiates cell signaling the research team discovered that a a r is represented by at least two inactive conformations and three active conformations whose populations are dependent on ligands and activation states of g protein and that communication between receptor and g protein is important for activation and signalling this study is expected to allow researchers to reach new level of insight in gpcr activation and disease mechanism figure activation of the human a a receptor shown in turquoise in complex with a g protein consisting of the and subunits shown in violet light blue and bark blue respectively is exquisitely controlled by changes in dynamics and action of the ligand highlighted in lime at the top of the figure activation pathways are observed to extend from the ligand binding site lime to the nucleotide binding site yellow in the g protein background gpcrs affect almost every aspect of human physiology where of all approved drugs act on gpcrs in most cases gpcrs are situated in the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell while the drug or ligand such as hormones and neurotransmitters that acts on the gpcr binds to an extracellular pocket activation is then transduced across the receptor resulting in complexation with proteins on the cell interior since input arrives at the cell exterior and initiates signalling pathways inside the cell this makes gpcrs useful in pharmacology as the drug in many cases need not enter the cell however gpcrs activations relate to dynamic events and key intermediate states that arise between the time that a ligand binds and when the g protein is activated capturing conformational dynamics of gpcrs and description of intermediate states and its role in activation and signalling has been a formidable challenge which has hampered progress in understanding activation mechanisms of gpcrs overview of research achievement using fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance f nmr mathematical rigidity theory and molecular dynamics simulations the international research team has discovered the key mechanism of activation of the human adenosine a a receptor a ar as it proceeds through signaling pathway a a r also known as caffeine receptor as it is deactivated by caffeine is a well known gpcr that is distributed in the nervous system platelets immune cells lungs heart and the vasculature a a r drugs have been developed to address wound healing vascular diseases including atherosclerosis restenosis and platelet activation in addition to inflammation and cancer thus understanding its functional states associated with receptor signaling can yield new opportunities in pharmacology and general understanding of gpcr activation mechanisms the researchers focused on biasing key conformational states of a a r by complexing it with g protein and different ligands to better understand signal transduction and receptor activation f nmr showed that a a r is represented by at least two inactive conformations and three active conformations associated with signaling pathway whose populations are dependent on ligands engagement and g protein interactions fig research team also used molecular dynamics simulations to create a structure of a a r bound to heterotrimer g protein complex performed by kitao lab where rigidity theory methods of sljoka identified an activation pathway where a a r initiates communication with the g protein which traverses the receptor s ligand binding site and g protein fig g subunit was discovered to serve as a critical domain for facilitating signaling and activation understanding the activation mechanism and functional states of a a r signaling may provide new opportunities for drug discovery figure f nmr spectra identifies at least active conformational states a a a and an inactive signature labeled as r above binding of receptor to full heterotrimeric g protein g significantly increase the population of active states the receptor adopts a specific active state a when it binds both full agonist and g protein figure computational analysis based on modelling and mathematical rigidity theory identifies an activation network pathway encompassing the receptor a a r the g subunit and the g subunits of g protein harboring the nucleotide shown in green g subunit was discovered to be critical for signalling and sampling of fully active states of receptor resulting in optimal receptor activation future development while the current study provides unprecedented resolution of key functional states associated with receptor signaling future studies will no doubt focus on other key domains providing a more comprehensive picture of the activation process reference department of chemistry university of toronto

transforming inexpensive quinolines into complex drug candidates scientists develop a cost effective methodology to produce various biologically relevant organic compounds from simple feedstock chemicals research published june an innovative synthesis strategy opened up the way to d d fused frameworks using inexpensive quinolines as feedstock report scientists from tokyo tech by leveraging a light sensitive borate intermediate the scientists could transform quinoline derivatives into a great variety of d d fused frameworks in a straightforward and cost effective manner their findings are expected to enable the synthesis of highly customizable drug candidates quinolines have garnered much attention from chemists wanting to synthesize compounds known as d d fused frameworks these complex organic molecules have a lot of medical potential due to their highly customizable structure and functional groups quinolines make synthesis of such frameworks possible thanks to their unique electronic configuration they consist of an electron abundant benzene ring fused to an electron deficient pyridine ring these electronically distinct rings can be modified independently by adjusting reaction conditions one of the most attractive ways to use quinolines as feedstock for d d frameworks is through dearomative photocycloadditions this process involves destabilizing one of the aromatic rings in quinoline using light and sometimes a catalyst so that a reactant can latch onto the ring forming the target compound despite many efforts most studies have reported photocycloadditions happening on quinoline s benzene ring side while few have targeted the pyridine side thus the full potential of quinolines remains untapped against this backdrop a research team from tokyo institute of technology japan led by assistant professor yuki nagashima in collaboration with scientists from the university of tokyo decided to step up to the challenge in their latest study which was published in angewandte chemie international edition on may they present a convenient methodology to access the pyridine side of quinolines and synthesize diverse d d frameworks the key to their approach lies in the use of a molecule known as pinacolborane also known as h b pin the researchers discovered that this boron containing compound was extremely effective at inducing dearomative photocycloaddition almost exclusively on the pyridine side of quinoline not only were the yields obtained high but also could a wide variety of quinoline derivatives and reactants be used to obtain all sorts of d d frameworks seeking to shed light on the mechanisms underlying their newfound strategy the team conducted a series of experiments and theoretical analyses they determined that quinoline reacts with an organolithium compound first and then with h b pin to form an intermediate borate complex this intermediate step is crucial as nagashima remarks our detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex both accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition reactions these effects combined lead to fewer unreacted compounds and undesired aromatics it is worth noting that the proposed methodology offers several advantages over competing techniques for one it requires less reaction time and steps than classic synthesis routes catalysts are not needed either which reduces costs further moreover multi substituted starting molecules can be used which provides access to countless target compounds to our knowledge these transformations are the first boron based photocycloadditions and unlock previously elusive organoboron compounds the present strategy based around an intermediate borate complex should be useful for further functionalization of various types of multi ringed aromatic hydrocarbons highlights nagashima with any luck this work will serve as the foundation for novel photoinduced cycloaddition strategies which in turn will lead to more effective and affordable drugs for challenging diseases reference corresponding authors emails nagashima y ae m titech ac jp y nagashima mol f u tokyo ac jp y n tanaka k cg m titech ac jp k t school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
synthesizing extended carbohelicene based circularly polarized luminescence emitters research published may helicines are known for their excellent circularly polarized luminescence properties but synthesizing them via conventional methods often leads to distortions in the molecular structure impacting the optical properties and stability of the molecules an issue recently overcome by researchers from tokyo tech they developed a strategy for enantioselective synthesis of carbo and helicenes the synthesized materials exhibited low distortions and showed cpl brightness as high as m cm helicenes are organic molecules that gained widespread popularity due to their unique helical conjugated molecular structure where the benzene rings are ortho fused resulting in excellent chiroptical properties such as circularly polarized luminescence cpl the ability to act as a cpl emitter makes helicenes ideal for a wide range of next generation optoelectronic applications such as optical information communication systems and d display systems higher order d extended carbohelicenes a type of helicine are expected to make excellent cpl emitters due to their high circular polarization brightness and stability however these exceptional properties of carbohelicenes cannot be completely exploited due to their highly distorted structure which hinders both their synthesis and enantiocontrol the control of the enantiomeric composition or the amount of left handed or right handed version of a molecule produced in a reaction to ensure that the full range of properties of carbohelicenes is accessible for application a team of researchers led by professor ken tanaka from tokyo institute of technology recently devised a new strategy that facilitated the enantioselective synthesis of d extended carbo and helicenes for the cpl emitters and their enantioselective synthesis with reduced distortions in their study the team reported the rh catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene based carbo helicene via intramolecular cycloaddition of a triyne followed by a extension by the scholl reaction we observed that even though this process overcame the drawbacks of conventional synthesis processes such as unwanted rearrangement reactions and low regioselectivity unfortunately the molecular distortion was still pretty high learning from those observations we designed a strategy to overcome the high distortions and improve cpl emission explains tanaka when asked about the inspiration behind their present work for this nature synthesis study the team carried out enantioselective synthesis of carbo and helicenes with an enantiomeric ratio of and overcame high distortions by combining the enantioselective synthesis of carbo and helicenes with triple cycloaddition which was followed by the extension helix diameter reduction by the scholl reaction the major advantage of the stepwise construction process of a fully ortho fused d extended carbohelicene backbone is that it overcomes the drawbacks associated with both enantioselective cycloaddition and scholl reaction to explore the material properties of the synthesized material the team carried out x ray crystallographic analyses which revealed that the d extended carbo and helicenes with rigid molecular backbones were conglomerates that favored preferential crystallization furthermore the most prevalent molecular forces among the carbohelicene layers were van der waals interactions upon testing the photophysical properties of the synthesized extended carbo and helicenes the team discovered that the cpl brightness reached a maximum of m cm one of the highest values among helicene derivatives reported in the literature overall this new approach to molecular design and enantioselective synthesis can provide a solid groundwork for further research and development of high performance carbohelicenes for cpl emitters of the future our study has opened new avenues for production and adoption of chiral organic molecule based cpl emitters with applications ranging from state of the art digital displays to efficient communication networks and essential biotechnological advancements concludes tanaka reference corresponding author s email ktanaka apc titech ac jp school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts school of science exploring the truth and creating knowledge information on school of science inaugurated in april school of science schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
an improved visible light harvesting catalyst to speed up reactions research published march visible light driven single transition metal catalysts are ideal for photoreactions their potential has finally been fully harnessed by researchers from tokyo tech who developed a catalyst with reduced substrate dependence and increased visible light harvesting ability this solves the limitations of previous catalysts including their restricted applications and opens up new avenues for photoreactions photocatalysis is the use of light to accelerate the rate of a reaction in the presence of a photocatalyst the catalyst plays a crucial role in this process it absorbs the light being shined onto it and makes it available in way that can help accelerate the chemical reaction and also enhance it these catalysts are used for a variety of light dependent reactions ranging from the production of paper to the conversion of carbon dioxide to fuel given these applications the development of ideal photocatalysts is important an ideal photocatalyst is one that uses a single transition metal that which perform both visible light absorption and chemical transformation currently visible light driven single transition metal catalysts are limited to only one mechanism of operation known as the radical mechanism or have a low light harvesting ability making them heavily dependent on certain substrates thus there is a need for an ideal single transition metal catalyst that solves these problems fortunately a team of researchers from tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech led by assistant professor yuki nagashima have reported a novel visible light driven single transition metal catalyst that solves these issues their findings are published in nature synthesis dr nagashima explains we envisioned unprecedented rhodium rh based photocatalysts spiro fluorene indenoindenyl sfi rh i complexes that combine high light harvesting abilities with broad applicability the team found that extending the molecules around the central rh atom called the ligand is necessary to increase the light harvesting abilities of these complexes but also makes them less stable thus the team designed sfi rh i complexes using a non fused extension strategy extending the molecules around the ligand without compromising the stability of the resultant catalyst in fact their extension strategy made the catalyst stable against protonation and helped in increasing its light harvesting ability thus reducing its substrate dependence the catalyst was also designed to be able to perform using multiple mechanisms beyond the radical mechanism used by previous catalysts the careful design of our catalyst enabled it to have many advantages compared to previously described catalysts while making it suitable for complex reactions the sfi rh i complexes can easily extend the scope of typical rh catalyzed reactions using blue light led irradiation at room temperature this concludes dr nagashima opens many avenues for future applications of these catalysts as well as photocatalytic reactions in general we believe that this catalyst has the potential to be a versatile light driven catalyst that can break through the ground state limitations in various photoreactions we look forward to seeing the many applications of their work reference corresponding author s email nagashima y ae m titech ac jp ktanaka apc titech ac jp school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
new horizons for organoboron and organosilicon chemistry with triple elementalization research published february a technique for easily modifying quinolines with carbon boron and silicon groups simultaneously has been unveiled by scientists at tokyo tech with organoboron and organosilicon compounds becoming more and more important in pharmaceuticals the novel technique could facilitate the development of new drugs moreover the modified quinolines can be readily used as convenient scaffolds for synthesizing organic chemicals in recent years organic chemicals containing boron b and silicon si have found applications in various fields including optoelectronics and pharmaceuticals moreover they can also serve as building blocks for complex organic chemicals as a result scientists are actively looking for new ways to leverage these versatile chemical tools as well as produce more kinds of organosilicon and organoboron compounds one limitation of the synthesis methods currently available for these chemicals is that we cannot introduce multiple b and si containing groups in aromatic nitrogen heterocycles i e carbon rings in which one of the carbon atoms is replaced by a nitrogen atom if we could produce and freely transform such molecules it would unlock the synthesis of several compounds relevant in medicinal chemistry fortunately a research team including assistant professor yuki nagashima from tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech japan found a straightforward way around this limitation as explained in their most recent study published in nature communications the team developed a method that allows them to modify quinolines small organic molecules with an aromatic nitrogen heterocycle with b si and carbon containing groups simultaneously their approach begins with a quinoline or a quinoline derivative that reacts with an organolithium compound with the desired carbon group this carbon group attaches itself at one of the carbon sites of the nitrogen heterocycle then a single compound containing the si and b groups joined by an si b bond is introduced this compound replaces the lithium atom and attaches itself through the b group at the nitrogen site finally by stimulating and eventually breaking the si b bond with blue light the b and si groups reorganize in a predictable fashion attaching themselves at different locations within the nitrogen heterocycle this in turn yields a triple hetero elementalized carbo sila boration quinoline derivative as the final product the team tested their synthesis approach to produce over quinoline derivatives some of which were produced in high yields most notably the proposed method provided excellent stereo chemo and regio selectivity meaning that the reaction produced the desired compound with high specificity to top it off the process was one pot and required only visible light as the additive greatly reducing the associated costs and time through various experiments and detailed computational analysis the team further revealed the mechanism at play behind their approach based on our calculations and experimental results we conclude that the on site generation of silyl radical species rather than silyl anions upon light irradiation facilitates the overall triple hetero elementalization reaction explains dr nagashima the insight will surely prove important for future chemists seeking to develop new synthesis methodologies based on this technique finally as a proof of concept the team tested a particular hetero elementalized quinoline as a scaffold for the synthesis of organic compounds put simply they tested how easily one could replace the si and b groups with arbitrary functional groups such as oh methyl and phenyl groups the results were promising as dr nagashima highlights with eyes on the future although chemo and stereoselective transformations of si b groups are still under study we believe the carbo sila borated quinolines could become versatile synthesis platforms let us see what interesting applications organic chemists can find for the method showcased by the tokyo tech team reference corresponding authors emails nagashima y ae m titech ac jp uchiyama mol f u tokyo ac jp ktanaka apc titech ac jp school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
less is more reduction allows for cleaner and more efficient catalytic reactions research published august in an ongoing effort to accelerate catalytic reactions oxidation of metal complexes using light has emerged as a standard method to synthesize aromatic compounds now researchers at tokyo institute of technology have demonstrated a high yield synthesis pathway through reduction of rhodium complexes using a newly designed catalyst that enables electron deficient elements to be added to aromatic compounds opening up possibilities to synthesize bioactive products and functional materials catalysts enable chemical reactions to be faster and more energy efficient and are widely used in industrial and biological processes every chemical reaction requires a certain minimum amount of energy to occur successfully catalysts lower this energy by combining with reactants to form low energy intermediates which go on to give the final product the metal rhodium rh is a good candidate for a catalyst as they can have multiple oxidation states that allow them to form complexes or intermediates with the reactants recently metal catalyzed reactions have been optimized using light to modify the oxidation state of the intermediate compound allowing researchers to successfully add various substituents known as functional groups to arenes hydrocarbons with carbon atoms forming rings most of these studies involve inducing a cationic positively charged intermediate with light that can facilitate exchange with electron rich functional groups to yield functionalized arenes now in a new study published in the journal of the american chemical society researchers from tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech have expanded the scope of light induced metal catalyzed reactions by demonstrating a synthesis method that uses an anionic negatively charged rh complex to enable the addition of an electron deficient boron group to an arene in their study they used a newly designed cyclopentadienyl cp rhodium based catalyst which initially formed a neutral complex with the arene this complex then underwent a reduction gain of electrons under light irradiation to form an anionic intermediate that in turn facilitated an exchange of a ligand a molecule attached to a metal atom with a diboron group to yield compounds called arylboronates in a process known as borylation professor yuki nagashima who led the study elaborates catalytic reactions are typically accelerated by oxidizing metal complexes to cationic intermediates we instead used a reductive strategy to catalyze borylation reaction of arenes through alternate reaction pathways the researchers initially determined the types of arenes that would form suitable intermediates with the catalyst through time dependent density functional theory calculations and then performed a screening for the catalyst for the borylation reaction after testing a variety of catalysts on arenes and the diboron group they found that the neutral metal complex had to be excited to a triplet state with light before it could be reduced to its anionic state to yield the corresponding arylboronate the new synthesis strategy worked for arenes containing a wide variety of functional groups and generated high yields up to furthermore compared to the conventional metal catalyzed borylation it used milder reactants and allowed borylation at room temperature making the process cleaner and more energy efficient we have developed the first protocol for generation of anionic metal complexes through photo excited reduction of cp rh intermediates this will pave the way for functionalization of other electron deficient elements such as silane and tin as well the synthesis of bioactive and functional compounds says nagashima speaking of the future prospects of their study after all reduction is definitely better when less is more reference department of chemical science and engineering tokyo institute of technology school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
touched by light photoexcited stannyl anions are great for producing organotin compounds research published may scientists at tokyo institute of technology developed a new strategy for producing a wide range of organotin compounds which are the building blocks of many organic synthesis methods their approach is based on the photoexcitation of stannyl anions which alters their electronic state and increases their selectivity and reactivity to form useful compounds this protocol will be helpful for the efficient synthesis of many bioactive products novel drugs and functional materials organotin compounds also known as stannanes are made of tin sn hydrocarbons and sometimes other elements like nitrogen and oxygen during the s stannanes rapidly took the spotlight as building blocks in the field of organic synthesis mainly because of their use as reagents in the stille reaction which remains essential for chemists to combine various organic molecules equally important to the organotin reagents are the techniques and molecules that we rely on to make them stannyl anions have gained their place as the most widely used precursor for organotin reagents however their chemical properties make them prone to partake in unwanted reactions that compete with the synthesis of the target organotin reagent this decreases yield and puts constraints on the main reaction restricting the possible organotin reagents that can be produced in practice surprisingly in a recent collaborative study by tokyo institute of technology and the university of tokyo japan scientists discovered a new type of stannyl species useful for producing organotin reagents in their paper published in the journal of the american chemical society they explain that this new stannyl species was first theorized to exist based on small anomalies observed in previous works during our studies involving stannyl anions we occasionally detected small amounts of compounds called distannanes that were probably generated by the irradiation of stannyl anions with light inspired by these observations we became interested in exploring the synthesis applications of these theoretical photoexcited stannyl anion species explains assistant professor yuki nagashima lead researcher from tokyo tech through density functional theory calculations the team determined that trimethyltin anion me sn a model stannyl anion has a special affinity for blue light which energizes the molecule to an excited single state from this state the system naturally progresses to another state known as excited triplet where two electrons are unpaired this easy to induce progression from a stannyl anion to a stannyl radical in an excited triplet state gives the stannyl species vastly different chemical properties including enhanced reactivity and selectivity towards certain compounds the scientists explored reactions between photoexcited stannyl anions and several compounds including alkynes aryl fluorides and aryl halides they found that the photoexcited stannyl species had unprecedented selectivity for the synthesis of various useful reagents that conventional stannyl anions could not easily produce moreover these photoexcited anions had a remarkable ability for the defluorostannylation and dehalostannylation of aryl molecules in simpler terms this means that if you have an aryl fluoride or halide an organic molecule with a fluorine or halide group respectively it is easy to set up a reaction that substitutes the fluorine or halide group with a stannyl group this allowed the researchers to create a wide variety of organotin reagents useful for stille reactions excited about the results prof nagashima remarks although many stannylation methods and reagents have been established over almost two centuries our protocol using photoexcited anion species provides a new and complementary tool for preparing a wide range of organotin compounds this new method will certainly be helpful for synthesizing many bioactive products novel drugs and functional materials and further studies are already underway to see how far it will take us illuminating stannylation illustration showing stannyl diradical species generated by photo excitation of stannyl anions this image was selected as a cover of the journal of the american chemical society reference graduate school of pharmaceutical sciences the university of tokyo department of chemical science and engineering tokyo institute of technology cluster for pioneering research cpr riken research initiative for supra materials rism shinshu university school of materials and chemical technology encompassing the disciplines of science information on school of materials and chemical technology inaugurated in april school of materials and chemical technology schools departments and institute for liberal arts subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin

facile synthesis of high performance perovskite oxides for acid base catalysis research published april a simple sol gel method for the synthesis of highly pure bifunctional perovskite type solid acid base catalysts has now been developed by tokyo tech researchers bifunctional acid base catalysts are important for industrial processes like petroleum refining and biomass conversion however the lack of simple and effective methods for catalyst synthesis limits their effective functionalization the new catalysts demonstrate remarkable catalytic performance for cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds bifunctional acid base catalysts are highly desirable for industrially relevant chemical processes owing to their ability to activate electrophiles and nucleophiles simultaneously they allow the catalysis to proceed synergistically and cooperatively solid acid base catalysts are particularly advantageous since they are reusable and result in no waste products however controlling the structure of such catalysts for cooperatively workable active sites is challenging simple and effective methods that enable the synthesis of high performance solid acid base catalysts with desirable properties are thus required a team of researchers led by professor keigo kamata from tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech japan have now proposed such a simple sol gel method for the synthesis of highly pure bifunctional solid acid base catalysts of perovskite type oxides advancing the frontiers of catalysis research their study was published in acs applied materials interfaces explaining the rationale for selecting perovskite type oxides prof kamata says perovskite type oxides are gaining importance in several fields including magneticity ferroelectricity piezoelectricity and catalysis moreover the structure and physiochemical properties of perovskite type oxides can be tuned by controlling their chemical composition perovskite type oxides have a versatile composition and demonstrate good structural stability flexibility and controllability for several catalytic reactions but they have not been sufficiently explored for acid base catalyzed reactions moreover the existing methods for synthesis are complex time consuming and require multiple steps making it difficult to synthesize highly pure and desirable perovskite oxide catalysts the sol gel method developed by the team to circumvent these challenges has two key steps the first involves preparing the precursor perovskite material while the second comprises a calcination process to improve the surface area of the material to prepare the precursor the researchers dissolved a metal alkoxide containing either titanium ti zirconium zr or niobium nb cations to a solution containing malic acid and hydrogen peroxide they then added a metal acetate containing an a site element to the solution and dried it to form a powdered precursor next they subjected the precursor to a calcination process by heating it to c in a nitrogen atmosphere and exposing it to air for hours the high temperature and the presence of oxygen crystallized the precursor and increased its surface area of the various catalysts synthesized using this method the one with srtio nanoparticles sr strontium displayed the highest catalytic activity it enabled efficient cyanosilylation of acetophenone with trimethylsilyl cyanide tmscn under mild reaction conditions without any thermal pretreatment upon examining the catalyst further the team found its specific surface area m g to be times higher than those of commercially available titanates m g prof kamata adds we observed that the synthesized nanoparticles could activate tmscn on the basic oxygen site and the carbonyl compound on the acidic ti site this cooperative activation mechanism was responsible for the high catalytic activity of the catalyst for the cyanosilylation reaction in summary this straightforward method for synthesizing highly pure perovskite oxides for catalysis could become a promising strategy for enabling reactions requiring mild conditions reference corresponding authors emails kamata k ac m titech ac jp keigo kamata hara m ae m titech ac jp michikazu hara subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
breaking the barrier low temp ammonia synthesis with iron catalysts and barium hydride research published april the haber bosch hb process produces ammonia in the presence of an iron catalyst at high temperatures and pressures making it energy intensive therefore developing new catalysts that enable the hb process at lower temperatures is crucial in this regard researchers from tokyo tech recently prepared metallic iron nanoparticles mixed with barium oxide and electron donor barium hydride which enhance the catalytic activity for ammonia production at temperatures as low as c the haber bosch hb process is one of the most important industrial chemical reactions it combines nitrogen and hydrogen gases in the presence of an iron based catalyst at high temperatures and pressures to produce ammonia fertilizer which helps provide food for over five billion people over the decades researchers have tried to bring down the reaction temperature of the hb process to increase the ammonia yield while reducing energy consumption to this end they have recently developed new catalysts based on other transition metals such as ruthenium cobalt and nickel which exhibit much higher catalytic activity than iron however these catalysts preferentially adsorb hydrogen atoms onto their surface at low temperatures of c which reduces nitrogen adsorption and thus hampers ammonia production this phenomenon known as hydrogen poisoning poses an obstacle to the low temperature hb process in this light researchers led by professor michikazu hara of the laboratory for materials and structures at tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech have refocused on iron based catalysts and modified them to produce ammonia at c their work is all set to be published in the journal of the american chemical society prof hara explains the motivation behind the research hydrogen poisoning is not strong for iron based catalysts therefore they may be used for the low temperature hb process but only when combined with an appropriate promoter that increases their catalytic activity in this work the researchers prepared metallic iron fe nanoparticles on calcium hydride cah particles with a mixture of barium oxide bao and barium hydride bah deposited on them a set of experiments revealed that the iron nanoparticles interact strongly with the hydride ions of both hydrides as a result hydrogen atoms move from the hydrides to the nanoparticles and get desorbed as hydrogen gas leaving behind electrons the hydrides donate these electrons to the iron nanoparticles it facilitates the breaking of nitrogen gas into atoms resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for ammonia production even at low temperatures the bah bao fe cah catalyst exhibited a turnover frequency of s at c and s at c under a moderate pressure of mpa these values orders of magnitude higher than those for catalysts based on other transition metals result from the ability of iron to prevent hydrogen poisoning by desorbing the adsorbed hydrogen atoms as hydrogen gas at low temperatures discussing the future potential of their work prof hara observes the bah bao fe cah catalyst facilitates low temperature hb process which consumes less energy as such it can reduce the use of fossil fuels and potentially lower global carbon emissions in addition iron is abundant and inexpensive which makes the hb process more sustainable there certainly is a need for a low temperature energy efficient ammonia production process that is both environment and pocket friendly reference laboratory for materials and structures tokyo institute of technology japan corresponding author s email mhara msl titech ac jp subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin
inexpensive reusable mn catalysts make for efficient alkylation of ketones with alcohols research published october a newly developed manganese mn catalyst facilitates efficient conversion of alcohols into diverse organic compounds without requiring the addition of a base and producing water as the only byproduct tokyo tech researchers find in a new study the mn catalysts are inexpensive reusable do not require large energy for waste treatment and demonstrate product yields as high as when synthesizing new compounds it is advantageous to have reactants that are widely available and a simple method which produces a high yield of products with little waste undesirable byproducts in this regard the alkylation of alcohols through a method known as borrowing hydrogen bh can transform alcohols into a diverse range of products with water as the only byproduct the reaction is centered around a catalyst and begins with a catalyst removing the hydrogen atoms from the alcohol to oxidize it into a carbonyl compound this highly reactive intermediate then undergoes a condensation reaction with different organic compounds to produce water and receives the hydrogen back from the catalyst to form the final product thus by borrowing hydrogen atoms the alkyl groups of alcohol can be easily transferred to a new organic molecule containing different substituents efforts have been made to make this reaction work with inexpensive bio compatible manganese mn catalysts however currently available mn catalysts require the addition of strong bases which generate more waste and complicate the catalyst regeneration process now in a new study published in acs catalysis researchers from tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech have synthesized a reusable mn catalyst that can carry out alkylation reactions of alcohols efficiently without the need for a base the research team led by assistant professor yusuke kita had been previously experimenting with precious metal ruthenium catalysts to carry out the alkylation of alcohols via the bh method they found that the addition of magnesium oxide mgo to the catalyst improved its hydrogenation capability wondering if mgo would have the same effect on mn based catalysts they co deposited mn oxide mno x and mgo nanoparticles on an aluminum oxide al o support to their delight the new catalyst successfully facilitated the alkylation reaction for a wide variety of ketones with alcohols reaching yields as high as further unlike conventional mn catalysts it was capable of alkylating ketone containing substrates such as cyano groups which would otherwise react with water in the presence of a base most importantly as the reaction did not produce any byproduct other than water the catalyst could be easily regenerated with a simple filtration method the present catalyst did not require the addition of homogeneous strong bases that are typically indispensable for these reactions and require large energy consumption for separation recycling and waste treatment says dr kita the team attributed the observed high catalytic activity to the close contact between the mno x and the mgo nanoparticles using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy a method that can identify chemical compounds by measuring the amount of light they absorb the researchers identified for the first time an mn hydride mn h species on the surface of the catalyst suggesting that mgo facilitates the efficient transfer of hydrogen the catalysis is due to mgo particles that co exist with the mno x species in the al o support and the electron donation from mgo to mno x enhances the reactivity of mn h species explains dr kita as a cost effective easily reusable catalyst mn mgo al o could therefore accelerate the adoption of alkylation reactions via bh and help produce diverse organic compounds in an environmentally friendly manner reference corresponding author s email hara m ae m titech ac jp subscribe to tokyo tech bulletin

foods research published july the development of an innovative fermentation model utilizing artificially constructed initial microbiota and sterile eggplant juice by researchers from tokyo tech provides valuable insights into microbial succession patterns and the production of metabolites through in depth microbiota analysis and correlation studies the researchers have revealed lactiplantibacillus plantarum to be involved in the production of lactic acid alanine and glutamic acid during the fermentation of eggplant juice shibazuke is a traditional japanese eggplant pickle produced by the process of fermentation using lactic acid bacteria lab lab which are commonly present in vegetables cause the spontaneous fermentation of vegetables resulting in the distinctive acidic flavor of pickles while lab are beneficial other species of bacteria and microbes that may be present in the food source can affect the food quality and safety advancements in the areas of food technology and nutrition have allowed the large scale fermentation of pickles via industrial fermenters where conditions that affect fermentation like temperature ph acid levels and salt content are closely monitored the important role of specific microbial populations in spontaneous fermentation and their interactions that influence the overall quality of fermented products have been vastly studied however studies to replicate spontaneous fermentation involving sterile raw materials and artificially constructed microbiota are limited in a bid to reveal the complex microbial succession changes in microbial populations during spontaneous fermentation and its effects on the final products associate professor takuji yamada from school of life science and technology tokyo institute of technology japan and dr kazunori sawada from innovation division gurunavi inc japan have conducted a novel study utilizing industrially produced shibazuke their research findings were published in the microbiology spectrum journal sharing the inspiration and rationale behind the present research work yamada team says investigation into the changes in microbial populations during the eggplant fermentation process and understanding the dynamics between them can provide critical insights additionally the important factors and underlying mechanisms that influence the metabolite composition in shibazuke can be revealed the researchers initially performed microbiota analysis of commercially produced shibazuke samples employing s rrna gene sequencing technique to study the characteristics of microbial population they observed two different patterns of microbial succession in shibazuke samples one where the populations of lab were replaced by aerobic bacteria whereas the other pattern revealed the dominance of lab till the end of fermentation the discovery of two distinct patterns of microbial succession motivated the researchers to model the production of shibazuke using an innovative research approach subsequently they inoculated filter sterilized eggplant juice with an artificially constructed microbiota containing six species of bacteria that were observed during the early phase of shibazuke production microbiota analysis of eggplant juice fermentation indicated a single microbial succession pattern with lab dominance marked by the skewed growth of lactiplantibacillus plantarum bacteria throughout the fermentation process furthermore the researchers conducted a correlation analysis to study the extent of similarities between shibazuke production and fermentation of eggplant juice the fermentation profiles of dissolved oxygen and ph correlated with the microbial populations during fermentation and was found to be similar in both methods moreover they identified l plantarum to be involved in the production of lactic acid alanine and glutamic acid during shibazuke production and eggplant fermentation the innovative model of eggplant juice fermentation developed by us can be easily extended to other spontaneous fermentation processes additionally it can reveal the role of specific initial microbiota on fermentation and its final products says yamada team emphasizing the potential applications of the research work this study can aid the development of superfoods that have enhanced nutritional profiles and probiotic products

researchers working at the front lines have selected one of the future scenarios to freely discuss how future advancements in science and technology can contribute to the realization of the scenario panelists renge jibu associate professor institute for liberal arts renge jibu tokyo tech star search panelists shoen kume professor school of life science and technology shoen kume tokyo tech star search panelists tatsuya yumiyama professor institute for liberal arts tatsuya yumiyama tokyo tech star search panelists asa ito director of future of humanity research center institute of innovative research asa ito tokyo tech star search facilitator hiroichi yanase professor institute for liberal arts hiroichi yanase tokyo tech star search drop in the number of traditional families yanase dlab s future scenario no depicts a future that new technology allows us to select to design or remove our own aging process in the era of the year life we will find many changes in family structures personal values and the balance between the mind and the body i would like to begin with the topic on family structures from associate professor jibu who conducts research in fields of business management human resources management and gender jibu i would like to start by examining how people perceives a family searching images with keywords family and photo on the internet most images share a common feature these search results show that many people have a traditional view of a family as consisting of a married man and woman who have children living together however statistics show that the number of these traditional families is declining looking at the number of households of japan from to population census the number of households with three or more people has decreased while the number of households with two or fewer people has increased in particular the number of households with one person is increasing rapidly we can say that a gap is already arising between the reality of the family and the conventional image of a family a married man and woman and their children household structures in japan one person households millions in the number of households with persons or less shows an upward trend while the number of household with persons or over shows a downward trend since trends in the number of private households of japan by size of household from to created by editing the population and households of japan statistics bureau ministry of internal affairs and communications accepting diversity in the family structure jibu recently i have come to understand that there are already various family structures in society but we simply have been unable to recognize them as family for example the book entitled kodomo wo sodate rareru nante omowana katta lgbtq to denntouteki na kazoku no korekara we never imagined that we could raise a child the future of lbgtq and the traditional family edited by daisuke furuta written by fumino sugiyama soshi matsuoka and tomoko yamashita introduces a couple consisting of a woman and a transgender man who was born with the body of a woman but views himself as a man the couple was provided with a sperm donation from a male friend and now the three of them raise the child together the book also introduces various family structures and describes how those structures also exist in japan in the future as our lifespan increases we will spend our life more in single person and two person households as well as in traditional families with parents and children moreover the family structure is expected to become increasingly diversified amidst such trends i imagine that society will accept a broader range of family structures i think that this would be a good thing views on family and marriage with broader options yanase professor jibu has shown that families become diversified as the number of traditional families decreases and the number of families that do not fit into the traditional family structure increases professor ito how does it make you feel ito i think it s wonderful to have more possibilities on the other hand i feel that it is still arduous decision to consciously choose options other than those that are taken for granted as normal when it comes to marriage there will be cases in which the partners enter into a marriage contract with a specified deadline from the very beginning and use a ledger to manage their money in such cases i think that marriage which was originally a matter of feelings and having a special place to belong to will be contracted and become a somewhat difficult undertaking yanase when our life expectancy is extended and we spend a longer time with our spouse our way of thinking about marriage will certainly change jibu in fact an increasing number of people are rationally assessing the cost of getting married or calmly considering if it s really in their best interest to marry a certain person the more rationally that people think the more people who decided that it s better not to get married it seems to be one reason the number of people decide against marriage is increasing yanase i see professor yumiyama could you comment on this matter yumiyama i am particularly concerned that diversification of the family structure may result in dismantling of the family in the s counterculture many attempts were made to dismantle the family for example people attempted to raise children in a community unfortunately none of those attempts were successful so i wonder how different family structures will work today cell division to maintain the body causes aging yanase moving on i would like to talk with professor kume who is working on regenerative medicine with induced pluripotent stem ips cells please share your thoughts on the realization of a human body with a lifespan of years why does aging of the human body occur kume the human body is supposed to be composed of more than trillion cells stem cells in each tissue support the maintenance and regeneration of the body through cell division stem cells are special cells that have both the ability to replicate themselves and differentiate into various cells they exist in various tissues of the human body such as skin hair and other organs stem cells provide support so that the tissues can continue to function while being regenerated the ability to regenerate differs for each type of tissue tissues such as skin blood hair and intestinal cells have a strong regenerative ability while other types of tissues do not some tissues such as the pancreas and kidney have almost no ability to regenerate the aging of the human body can be explained by the process of cell division the process of continual cell division develops damages by stress inflammation and reactive oxygen species the errors or damages have been accumulated in the cells with aging furthermore if an error occurs during division this might direct the cells to progress as cancer tissue stem cells that maintain our body homeostasis human body with a lifespan of years aging and regeneration progress in medical technology and innovative research using ips cells against aging kume meanwhile innovative treatments are currently being developed to combat illness and aging for instance in the field of regenerative medicine that regenerates cells and helps tissue repair the advent of ips cells has contributed to remarkable advancements in cell transplantation and organ regeneration ips cells are pluripotent stem cells artificially created by reprogramming somatic cells ips cells can differentiate and proliferate into various cells that make up the body for example by utilizing the properties of ips cells it is possible to direct human ips cells to create hematopoietic stem cells and then use the created cells to treat leukemia furthermore by transforming human ips cells derived from patients into disease related cells and investigating the process of abnormalities it is possible to clarify the mechanism of intractable diseases this is also useful for the development of therapeutic drugs recently it was reported that the progression of als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which is an intractable disease that gradually impairs physical freedom had possibly been stopped for the first time in the world by a therapeutic drug candidate discovered using ips cells similarly clarifying in detail the mechanisms that cause the human body to age it may be possible to create a drug that suppresses aging then we will move closer to the advent of a society in which people have a lifespan of years issues to consider soaring medical costs regenerative medicine stem cells can be used to generate healthy cells to displace diseased cells understanding of how disease occur and develop new drugs using stem cell derived from patients ongoing studies improved our understanding of the disease infective disease drug vaccine development understanding the mechanism of aging and develop drug to slow down aging issues to consider soaring medical costs human body with a lifespan of years the development of novel therapy challenges arising from the years life yanase at dlab we examine technology and social systems for supporting the ideal future i think people face new challenges as a life expectancy of years is becoming a reality kume that s right first there is the problem of increased medical costs and expenses should society establish universal healthcare or should people be required to pay themselves after exceeding a certain range we must also consider how to maintain the quality of life when science makes it possible to restore a part of physical functions jibu i am sure that many people want to live a healthy and vibrant life for years how can we make that possible also is there a way to maintain quality of life despite the decline of some physical functions kume as is often said exercise and a healthy diet are important to maintain a healthy body furthermore even if some physical functions have declined i feel that the progress of science is now making it possible to engage in activities while making the best use of existing functions through technology religion for the unrelenting suffering of life over thousands of years yanase longevity will require mental care greatly professor yumiyama leads a study on religiosity and religious awareness in modern times would you please discuss what will happen to religion when people live for years yumiyama ever since the days of the buddha religion has provided comfort for the unrelenting suffering of life there is a buddhism phrase that the four inevitables in human life are birth aging sickness and death as expressed by this phrase people suffered when things didn t go as planned in life from around bc by becoming aware of these realities of life religions and philosophies were born in india china greece and other parts of the world that have greatly influenced later times the philosopher jaspers named this major turning point the axial age looking at modern society it seems that people are suffering just as much as they were thousands of years ago at some point in time people may even be able to achieve immortality however even if people can choose whether or not to age the suffering associated with aging will continue to exist for example imagine if one partner in a married couple chooses to grow old but the other chooses not to age why won t you enjoy youth together with me why won t you grow old together with me such conflicts would arise later life and human happiness determined by relationships with others yumiyama in buddhism in addition to birth aging sickness and death saying farewell to loved ones and encountering hateful people are mentioned as forms of human suffering it is often said that happiness is subjective however since most of the joy and suffering in life is only possible due to the existence of other people it can be said that happiness in life is determined by relationships a geriatric facility in a temple in mashiko town tochigi photo by tatsuya yumiyama here is a photograph of a facility for the elderly in mashiko town tochigi prefecture this facility is in the temple grounds and also has a hospice at the large entrance to the facility a statue of buddha quietly watches over residents the residents often say i don t want to bother my family and in a half joking tone they say to each other let s go to the land of happiness together an attitude survey of elderly society conducted by the ministry of health labour and welfare found that approximately of elderly individuals want a form of long term care that is independent from their family however is this form of later life truly decided by one s own will perhaps due to housing conditions family work and lifestyle differences with their children s generation elderly people are forced to make their own decision even if we gain a high degree of control over the process of physical aging and death the form of later life may not be decided by the individual nor by others instead it may ultimately be determined due to various events in many cases these various events are troublesome and there is room for prayer and wishes in the form of religion even if it becomes possible to design or remove your own aging process in people may still be praying to the gods and buddha religion not only in times of crisis but in everyday life ito i am very sympathized with professor yumiyama s comment that elderly people actually being forced to make decisions i also feel that although the role of religion in crisis situations is often discussed religion can fulfill a major role in the stage before a crisis after an event such as a major illness or disaster there tend to be few available options therefore the way in which we cultivate relationships with other people prior to a crisis is very important religion is involved in the formation of such relationships moreover i believe that religion has a vital role in everyday life yumiyama it has been a long time since japan has been described as a society in which individuals are isolated and have weak interpersonal links nowadays there is a movement of temples and shrines which are the core of traditional religions becoming the center of the community and trying to connect people this will make it easier for local people to participate than if a secular group were to take the lead awareness toward care during the year life with a greater need for nursing care and long term care yanase finally i would like professor ito director of the future of humanity research center to share her view regarding care in the year lifespan professor ito has conducted research in a wide range of themes such as the human body and aesthetics and is currently working on a research project on altruism ito if a person lives for years regardless of how long the healthy life expectancy is extended the period of receiving nursing care and long term care from another person will be longer and the number of people receiving nursing care and long term care will increase i hope that in the midst of such changes society as a whole will be able to recognize that the issue of care is not special rather it is a common issue for all of us therefore in addition to care and the labor of care in a narrow sense i would also like to discuss general labor currently salaries for jobs such as nursing care and long term care are lower than average furthermore it is said that these jobs have low social status what is the reason for this trend on a global scale i believe that the cause is how human labor is judged by numbers or put more simply by productivity therefore it is difficult to evaluate labor such as care which is hard to clearly quantify the concept of essential workers became known as a result of covid we are now more aware that how society is highly dependent on people who are working hard in indispensable jobs to maintain daily life i feel that it is important to reconsider the meaning of care and care labor care is unquantifiable or unable to plan but the core of every job ito the most important parts of all jobs including nursing care and long term care are unquantifiable for example in the case of university faculty members a strong emphasis is placed on results such as the number of papers written and the number of citations however another important part of the job is care in the form of spending time with students who suddenly visit the laboratory indeed i find time spent providing care to be very fulfilling it really bothers me that the pursuit of productivity limits the amount of time that i can spend with students the same thing is happening in a variety of different jobs in reality care should be at the center of labor however the parts of jobs related to care are not evaluated and work becomes nothing more than a way to make a living people are unable to find value in their jobs and working becomes a burden recently a book entitled bullshit jobs a theory written by david graeber has received a great attention which explained a current situation that wages for jobs essential to society are low as such problems spread around the world i hope that the arrival of the year life will be an opportunity to reconsider how care is at the core of every job care consists of dealing with the situation and needs of the person in front of you for example worries illness or needing to use the restroom basically care cannot be controlled or planned trying to plan care in advance for your own convenience will place a burden on the person receiving care today s society emphasizes planning controlling things and increasing productivity but there are other important concepts as well the altruism which i am currently studying also exists outside of planning and control i believe that such an attitude will change the meaning of worker and make things more comfortable for those involved in care the importance of evaluating things which cannot be quantified yanase in an era where people live for years there will most likely be an increase not only in professional care but also mutual care within the family jibu currently the proportion of women in charge of unpaid care work such as nursing care childcare and housework in the home is overwhelmingly high data shows that the ratio of women is twice as high as men in most developed countries in japan the ratio of women in charge of free care work is five times that of men on the other hand in the world of business and research it is important to achieve results through planning and control and there is an idea that providing care is a hindrance the attitude of people will change drastically once everyone has become involved in some form of care such as nursing care ito gender equality is not just about equalizing the social status of men and women it also consists of treating care work in the home equally to the job labor since it has been treated as secondary behind the job labor and has not been properly evaluated i think that the concept care is at the core of every job is an idea that was created based on research in gender studies yanase professor kume how do you view this matter kume in fact in the medical field there are situations in which care is not properly evaluated for example when a doctor listens to a patient and provides an explanation the medical fee will not change regardless of time for consultation of minutes or minutes it is necessary to review whether labor including care is being evaluated correctly exploring prescriptions for the future from multiple perspectives yumiyama as we enter an era in which people live for years it is necessary to thoroughly consider the concept of care i am sure that this is a difficult matter for everyone under such circumstances i felt hopeful when i heard professor ito state that i find time spent providing care to be very fulfilling being involved in care also means accumulating experiences that will change values ito caring for people can be a daunting task but it also provides us with a completely different perspective indeed with such experiences the phrase the year life will sound different yanase today s panel featured multifaceted discussion with four professors in conjunction with scientific advancements we must persevere in determining how to live when we are blessed with a lifespan of to years at tokyo institute of technology we will continue to discuss matters from various perspectives and strive to give specific prescriptions for the future thank you very much dlab future

tokyo tech to introduce new admission methods female student quotas education information published november amidst its sustained efforts to promote diversity and inclusion tokyo tech has decided to introduce special quotas for japanese speaking prospective female students applying to the institute s bachelor s degree programs through the recommendation based entrance exam selection method and the comprehensive entrance exam selection method from april onwards four of tokyo tech s schools the school of materials and chemical technology the school of computing the school of life science and technology and the school of environment and society will adopt the new framework in april while the school of science and the school of engineering will do so in april once the new admission procedures come into effect at all schools the new quotas will make positions available exclusively for female students this constitutes approximately percent of the students admitted to tokyo tech s bachelor s degree programs each year these changes will not affect the application process for english speaking prospective students formerly known as the admissions office ao entrance exam not just a more diverse tokyo tech despite various initiatives to encourage more female students to study and conduct research at tokyo tech the percentage of women in bachelor s degree programs stood at approximately percent as of may the introduction of female only quotas aims to boost this figure and promote one of the institute s key policies diversity and inclusion on tokyo tech s campuses as a result tokyo tech expects the ratio of female students to reach percent at each of its schools and to surpass this figure across the entire institute new proactive measures aim to increase this ratio further in the more distant future while certain leading institutions have achieved a female ratio of percent or higher in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics stem efforts to reduce this gap further continue globally at japanese universities however the disparity is particularly noticeable tokyo tech hopes that its efforts will develop into a movement among science and engineering focused and other universities in the country which together can take a big step towards closing the gap between the number of women and men studying for stem related degrees revision of recommendation based and comprehensive entrance exam selection methods japanese speaking prospective students seeking to join tokyo tech s bachelor s degree programs can apply in one of three ways general admissions for the bachelor s program the recommendation based entrance exam selection method or the comprehensive entrance exam selection method regardless of the method all applicants must take the common test for university admissions a japanese standardized test used nationwide for university admissions general admissions for the bachelor s program consists of two stages the common test for university admissions and tokyo tech s own evaluation of each individual applicant during this process all applicants are subject to the same selection methods examination subjects and examination questions the total number of applicants accepted for admission each spring through this process is currently which accounts for approximately percent of all applicants the recommendation based and comprehensive entrance exam selection methods on the other hand vary slightly for each tokyo tech school applicants who choose one of these paths apply to the specific school of their preference they must take the common test for university admissions and fulfill any additional requirements prescribed by each school those applying through the recommendation based entrance exam selection method must also obtain a reference which is often provided by the principal of their high school under the current system only the school of science utilizes this method while the other five schools the school of engineering the school of materials and chemical technology the school of computing the school of life science and technology and the school of environmental and society use the comprehensive entrance exam selection method the total number of annual applicants accepted for admission through these two methods is currently which makes up approximately percent of all applicants in the new framework each tokyo tech school will adjust the content of their respective recommendation based and comprehensive entrance exam selection methods and the number of students admitted based on these methods will increase future applications through the recommendation based and comprehensive entrance exam selection methods will fall into two categories the general quota for all applicants regardless of gender and the female only quota the evaluation criteria between these two categories will differ and hence so will the selection methods female applicants may apply for both categories the increase in the number of applicants applying through these methods will result in a decrease in the number of students admitted based on general admissions for the bachelor s program the total number of applicants accepted for each school will remain unchanged from academic year onwards when all tokyo tech schools have adopted the new framework the number of applicants admitted through general admissions for the bachelor s program will decrease to applicants from the current applicants the total number of applicants admitted through the comprehensive and recommendation based entrance exam selection methods will increase to applicants from the current applicants this will include applicants in the general quota and applicants in the female only quota each school with their unique approach each school at tokyo tech will apply a unique approach to applicants taking the comprehensive or recommendation based entrance exam path the major changes for each school as of november are listed below school of science school of engineering school of materials and chemical technology school of computing school of life science and technology school of environment and society through the implementation of these changes tokyo tech hopes to open up more opportunities for female students who want to create a better future through innovative science and engineering diversity and inclusion tokyo tech commits to realizing cultural development and contribution to human welfare by creating an intellectually vibrant environment diversity and inclusion at

president and professors of tokyo tech and a leading scientist from harvard university discuss the ideal environment for research and education global research published september on july under the theme of how should universities promote cutting edge research and human resource development that will create future society president kazuya masu professor amir yacoby of harvard university professor of physics and applied physics and professor mutsuko hatano of the school of engineering participated in a three way discussion facilitated by associate professor ayuko hoshino of the school of life science and technology this press release introduces the discussion between professor yacoby a world renowned authority on quantum research and the president and professors of tokyo institute of technology tokyo tech based on what he glimpsed during international joint research with professor hatano yacoby talked about the current state and prospects of the research and educational environment at tokyo tech japan and the rest of the world top left to right professor yacoby associate professor hoshino bottom left to right professor hatano president masu entering an era where global networks are essential for excellent research professor yacoby you have published many influential papers in leading academic journals such as nature and you are at the forefront of quantum research would you please begin by discussing your current research and how you got involved in collaborative research with the hatano laboratory yacoby currently under themes such as spin quantum bits and topological quantum systems i m working to understand the physical properties of solids and to apply that knowledge to quantum science and information technology i am also actively engaging in collaborative research and i was recently contacted by professor hatano hatano president masu often discusses the importance of exchanges with world class researchers so i decided to go all in and sent an email to professor yacoby which he kindly accepted yacoby professor hatano is conducting interesting research on diamond quantum sensors from the perspective of application to fields such as sensor development i am working on the same theme from the perspective of understanding physical properties so i thought that our collaborative research would produce a highly synergistic effect masu in this day and age networks are an important aspect of conducting outstanding research therefore at tokyo tech we are also focusing our efforts on in depth international joint research such as the current program where researchers stay for periods such as two weeks or one month i am very grateful to professor yacoby not only for his research at the laboratory but also for how he has provided far reaching stimulation both inside and outside tokyo tech through seminars and other sessions yacoby i am also very pleased that i was able to develop new measurement methods and learn a variety of application methods hatano as the next phase in our collaboration a doctoral student from my lab will conduct research at professor yacoby s lab in the united states for three months professor yacoby your lab has produced many outstanding professionals with ph d s who lead research at advanced corporations in the united states professionals with ph d s are widely active in both research and industry right yacoby a ph d is a prerequisite for employment at an academic research institution in the united states even in industry it is difficult for someone with only a bachelor s or master s degree to obtain a research position at a leading company such as ibm or google this is especially true for fields such as quantum mechanics a ph d is the ticket to such jobs hatano during his stay in japan professor yacoby was surprised by the low number of doctoral students one reason for the low number is the lack of employment opportunities japan needs to broaden the fields in which professionals with a ph d can fulfill an active role and to enable such professionals to diversify their career paths masu the power of human resources with ph d s is essential both for the revitalization of japanese society and the development of science and technology therefore as a university we would like to further strengthen our efforts in this area it s all about people supporting and fostering young researchers professor yacoby is also an executive committee member of the harvard quantum initiative hqi what does the hqi do to promote research yacoby harvard university has identified quantum science as an important research area and hqi has developed a ph d program to promote employment in addition a portion from hqi s research funding is provided to postdoctoral students as seed funding they can gain experience of the process of getting grants where they prepare proposals for grant applications their proposals are evaluated and the best ones are supported in this way start up of various ideas is promoted hatano that the processes of obtaining seed funding is a source of future i felt that the environment is designed to provide opportunities for young researchers and for creation to occur moving on to individual project management what do you think about the role of the principal investigator pi yacoby as a scientist the first priority must be scientifically creative the second is to provide mentoring to students recognizing that it is through mentoring that we guide them in their research and studies as well as their contributions and the third is that we also need to try to raise funds for the publication of articles and papers in this sense the role of pi is as diverse as being the ceo of a start up company i believe it is necessary for the growth to fulfill various aspects such as employment fundraising and pr i think mentoring publishing and publishing activities are all important in the exercise of scientific creativity but if you had to prioritize them in what order would they be yacoby if you eliminate scientific creativity you will have nothing left i really think that what matters is mentorship because mentorship is what allows you to benefit the most from the creativity of the human resources masu it reminds us of the importance of mentorship and the creativity that comes from them research is invigorated by various forms of diversity such as different experiences and fields in recent years expectations toward cutting edge quantum research are heightening yacoby we are conducting research on quantum computers in cooperation with corporations such as ibm however it looks like a little more time will be required to produce results it seems that the quantum sensor being developed by professor hatano will be put into practical use sooner hatano we can resolve social issues by realizing the dream of quantum utilization through the combination of the scientific field of understanding physical properties and applied technology collaboration across fields is essential for this goal this is the exact reason for my collaborative research with professor yacoby masu i expect that the results of quantum research will lead to major advances in semiconductor devices which is my field of expertise for example we could change the world dramatically by achieving quantum symmetry similar to cmos which is a mainstream semiconductor structure yacoby the integration of knowledge is essential for practical application when selecting a research environment the most important thing is to consider the type of people with whom you can conduct research of course facilities and research support systems are important however interacting with outstanding partners will improve your own creativity and collaborative research can have a synergistic effect that impacts society to a degree that exceeds individual research therefore we always try to be inclusive and we strive to make our research and work environment feel comfortable for all masu for example after being involved in fundamental research and practical application at a certain corporation professor hatano is now active in applied research at tokyo tech in addition to nationality and gender diversity of fields and experiences will invigorate research activities for this reason tokyo tech is promoting the creation of an environment filled with intellectual vitality by declaring tokyo tech diversity and inclusion statement professor yacoby in closing could you discuss what you are careful of when instructing students and give some advice for students yacoby i don t view myself as a supervisor of students rather i act as an adviser and collaborator to support their research activities accordingly i try to interact with students in a way that elicits their interests and helps them achieve their research goals and career development some advice that i give to students in my lab is that creativity is made possible by letting the mind wonder focusing only on being efficient is not necessarily the best way also in the case of students who are unsure about their research theme or career path instead of being overly focused on searching for a theme while still in the early stages of their education i would advise that they start by finding a good adviser hatano professor yacoby has taught me many things that go beyond research some examples are methods of instructing students and the need to assess research from a high vantage point it would be wonderful if we could continue to expand our systems for international exchange yacoby i am also looking forward to our next collaboration masu i also look forward to working together in terms of conducting excellent research and contributing to society i think that this discussion once again highlighted the importance of developing and acquiring outstanding human resources and then forming a network among those resources thank you very much for

receiving certificate comments from certified students newest student accessibility leaders yuki ozaki st year school of materials and chemical technology as a peer life coach i am involved in creating text and images for articles distributed to students twice a month using the line app these articles are read on smartphones which have a narrow width so maintaining high visibility is required this is why i got interested in accessibility during alp i learned about tools such as voiceover multiple architecture standards and many other new things takanori urano nd year industrial engineering and economics i am a member of science techno an official tokyo tech student club that holds science related craft classes for elementary school students we have also organized events with the special needs branch of a high school to expand on these activities i started a new student club called kutsubako at tokyo tech where we focus on heightening awareness on diversity related issues such as the braille writing system sign language and gender we have organized various activities related to these topics i want to apply what i learned at alp to making slides and websites that are easy to understand for everyone including elementary school students and other people with various needs sekai narita nd year materials science and engineering i teach crafts to children as a member of science techno an official tokyo tech student club through alp i realized once again that there are many different types of disabilities and that each of them must be addressed individually it is also important to display compassion and to show consideration that is based on knowledge knowledge and information in this field is constantly renewed and therefore i would like to continue my accessibility studies so i stay up to date risako yanagase nd year transdisciplinary science and engineering i study a broad range of science and engineering fields and aim to make science accessible and easy to understand for everyone as a taki plaza gardener and peer life coach i am also involved in the planning and operation of taki plaza and the support for new students i am interested in communicating with people from different backgrounds and there were many things i learned that i can apply to my future research i also learned that there are people who feel inconvenienced in unexpected situations in their daily lives and this has made me more attentive regarding my surroundings kanta okuzawa rd year mathematics i am currently studying probability theory i once saw a visually impaired person with a white cane who appeared to be in some sort of trouble but i was unable to do anything because i did not know how to interact with him i felt truly unworthy and sensed that i needed to learn how to provide better access to this society which demands diversity this is what sparked my interest in accessibility and motivated me to attend the accessibility leader camp tatsuya kobayashi rd year chemical science and engineering i am a club member of both science techno and chemtech at tokyo tech i have often seen statements about accessibility when setting up a smartphone or creating a powerpoint document but i was not particularly aware of it before alp i am now able to consider documents from various perspectives not just from the viewpoint of being easy to read i want to continue trying to create documents that take accessibility into consideration tokutaro yamaguchi rd year mechanical engineering while studying at the department of mechanical engineering at the school of engineering i also hold seminars with friends and enjoy programming and photography as hobbies one accomplishment i achieved through alp was learning what is required not only for accessibility in various physical areas places where we need to consider things like handrails hallways parking lot widths and elevator sizes but what is required in terms of accessible web layout hayato koriyama rd year mathematics in academic year i will join a lab that focuses on mathematical analysis in academic year i was the representative of the official student club science techno which practices science communication with elementary school students i called on the members of the club to join alp because i thought it would be beneficial for our activities ryota uehara rd year materials science and engineering our department specializes in organic materials and in academic year i will join a lab that mainly conducts research on polymeric materials i enjoyed alp because i was able to gain knowledge that i normally would not have come across knowledge that i want to utilize in the future i also learned that people face challenges in their daily lives that we usually do not think about yuma nagao st year master s student chemical science and engineering i am currently conducting research on molten borate with the aim of unifying co collection and use a big part of my motivation to join alp was my membership in science techno a science communication student club during my undergraduate years at tokyo tech once again it was great to learn new things as we strive towards a more diverse world yuki tate st year master s student mathematical and computing science i am conducting research on information visualization technology and applications that use social networking and other big data to gain a better understanding of society before alp i was not aware of facilities that i do not use but through this program i was able to learn among other things how parking spaces for the physically impaired are installed takeshi senoo nd year master s student information and communications engineering i belong to a lab that works on co designing software and hardware to accelerate machine learning i was able to utilize my existing knowledge to evaluate correctly about of what was covered in alp but the other was new something that i would not have noticed if i did not study it although i may not remember all the detailed figures that were presented i felt that the content would provide useful hints to look back on when making decisions in the future yui takeuchi nd year master s student life science and technology i conduct research on food ingredients that have stress reducing effects during the covid pandemic as i went job hunting i started thinking about diversity and decided to learn about accessibility i am planning to get a job at a b to c company in fiscal year and as my future customers will be in various unique situations i am glad that i was able to expand my knowledge regarding this topic i thought i knew what there is to know about disabilities and barrier free access but at alp i was surprised to learn about the existence of knowledge i wasn t aware of earlier acquiring this knowledge was truly a learning experience i am glad that i was able to learn about various fields in a balanced manner kodai yaguchi st year doctoral student electrical and electronic engineering i belong to a lab that deals with healthcare electromagnetic environments and social harmony using wireless communication and radio technology at alp i was able to learn a wide range of methods for improving accessibility in terms of both characteristics of the human body and social systems i felt that what i learned can be applied in various situations where i interact with people certified student and staff accessibility leaders with student guidance and accessibility section head noriko michimata front th from left

department of mathematics school of science it is difficult to see four dimensional manifolds figures in real life in modern mathematics we are able to visualize them by decomposing them into handles my research theme contemplates the four dimensional sphere before we started studying pure mathematics in university we learned about spheres as two dimensional figures however mathematics allows us to consider higher dimensional spheres visualizing four dimensional manifolds helps us to investigate four dimensional spheres and results in further development of mathematics i am extremely intrigued by this challenging worthwhile and groundbreaking work enjoying the beauty of paths that past mathematicians have built ryo komiya st year master s student ay department of mathematics school of science i am studying generalization of what is known as iwasawa theory in number theory before i started to learn this specific theory none of the integer questions i had practiced at high school looked connected each other but now i m beginning to understand the connection thanks to the theory my joy is gaining the ability to understand something i was unsure before as i continue working on the subject one of the charms of learning mathematics is to be able to trace and enjoy the beauty of the paths that mathematicians have built to date collaborating with researchers worldwide to unravel the origins of the universe shota izumiyama st year master s student ay department of physics school of science i research in the field of elementary particles the smallest particles in existence as well as the most fundamental units of nature my aspiration is to better understand the types and nature of elementary particles to discover fundamental answers to the natural

department of earth and planetary sciences school of environment and society planets like earth are thought to have formed as a result of collision and the gathering of dust from protoplanetary disks structures composed of dust and gas i am focusing on the unique composition of jupiter s atmosphere and am trying to figure out the process of the formation of the planet by simultaneously calculating the growth of dust and the temperature structure change over time to me it is fun and fascinating to compare simulation output with observed results and derive a scenario through a number of trials and errors creating an attractive space an approach from the structural field keiichiro sada th year bachelor s student ay department of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society architecture is not just an engineering discipline that focuses on monozukuri high quality manufacturing but it is also an academic field focusing on people who use buildings among them the steel structure that i am currently studying cannot be separated from the creation of large spaces where many people spend time such as public facilities and high rise buildings we hope to clarify the behavior of structures through experiments and analysis which will give us more flexibility to design and make spaces with steel frames more attractive learning architecture through practice in society yukako masui nd year master s student ay department of architecture and building engineering school of environment and society in our laboratory we designed and built tiny houses by ourselves in a satoyama a natural landscape close to a rural village where we regularly visit we also visited five asian countries for actual measurement and to measure the thermal environment at places where people are working under trees we will produce architectural designs and a thesis based on our thoughts while moving practically in society i feel the potential architecture has to give form to intangible things such as technology faith and natural circulation and by fostering the culture of the people in the community aiming to support japan s infrastructure by becoming a concrete expert kyoka inoue rd year bachelor s student ay department of civil and environmental engineering school of environment and society i was able to look at my major with renewed interest when i found out that the study of infrastructure encompassed a broad range of topics including communications and ecosystems i especially love laboratory courses as they enable me to deepen my understanding through observing the difference between theory and practice when i advance to my fourth year i would like to join a laboratory of my choosing after having acquired enough knowledge in a wide range of fields i want to do research on concrete so that i can contribute to building a robust infrastructure that would withstand japan s natural disasters engineering thinking and working for society saki ohkawara th year bachelor s student ay department of civil and environmental engineering school of environment and society what is a truly sustainable society we are thinking about this issue from various perspectives such as urban planning and rural landscape the world of civil engineering and environmental engineering which jumped into my interest while focusing on disaster prevention and environmental issues was more connected to every aspect of society than i had imagined it makes me realize that it is not so easy to dig deeply into current issues and to discuss future processes in a realistic manner however i feel that the complexity and sociality of the process is what makes this research so fascinating to become the generalist with strong on site skills on top of academic expertise aoi matsunaga st year master s student ay department of civil and environmental engineering school of environment and society the soil water index is an indicator used for issuing warnings and advisories against landslide disasters in japan but it may not be effective for prediction in certain regions because it applies the same calculation methods and parameters throughout the country in my research i am trying to identify appropriate parameters for each region by comparing the indicator s readings corresponding to the actual occurrences of such disasters at locations with different soil natures and land usage i hope this will lead to precise predictions of disasters and provide clues to developing land with fewer disaster risks becoming an engineer with a multifaceted perspective kei matsumura st year master s student ay department of civil and environmental engineering school of environment and society from the research we have conducted so far through questionnaires and interviews with the personnel engaging in railway maintenance and management track maintenance and civil engineering and surveys on bridge conditions we have sorted out ideas on maintenance and management of structures safety workload etc the fostering of the ideas thereof and tangible and intangible demands we hope that these results will lead to the future direction of technology development and the discussion of a rational organizational structure i am currently studying in france to become an engineer with a multifaceted perspective it is not just words considering approaches to communication risako yanase st year master s student ay department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society while working at the department of transdisciplinary science and engineering with students and researchers from diverse backgrounds including their scientific fields and nationalities i found issues when trying to communicate verbally with others as i could not convey my thoughts to them as well as i imagined currently i am conducting research on communication methodologies to reduce discrepancies that may arise in discussions and to facilitate common understanding as an example we have created meeting minutes that utilize sketches symbols etc to intuitively grasp the content of discussions and we have verified their effectiveness through practice and analysis common but unsolved problems are the source of new discovery and learning marina wada st year master s student ay department of transdisciplinary science and engineering school of environment and society i am working on developing a littering behavior model using data on smart trash bins in locations with a continuous flow of people quantitatively evaluating littering behavior will help determine the optimal locations of trash bins and collection times and will lead to a reduction of litter on streets i am currently
